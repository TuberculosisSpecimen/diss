This site is designed with two main functions in mind: the application of an opacity filter, as well as the inclusion of definitions in a mouseover function.

## The Opacity Filter

If you look to the left side of this page, you'll see a panel with three buttons: <b>Transparent</b>, <b>Partially Opaque</b>, and <b>Opaque</b>. These buttons will toggle specific changes in the website that you are viewing when you press them.<br><br>

The three levels of opacity are defined as follows:<br><br>

1. Non-opaque adds no filtering whatsoever to the images or text. It is just as I have written them.<br><br>

1. <span class="opaque-lines"><span class="partial-lines">Partial opaque applies opacity in such a way as to protect the privacy of the patient, but keeps the scientific information gleaned from the subject intact. This corresponds with contemporary norms regarding privacy.</span></span><br><br>

1. <span class="opaque-lines">Finally, full opacity takes into consideration that the subject probably didnâ€™t consent in the first place, and erases all index of the body (direct or indirect) from the material described, cited, or evoked in the argument.</span><br><br>

<img id="CityofChicagoMunicipalTub1-4_1917-1924_44" class="opaque" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/CityofChicagoMunicipalTub1-4_1917-1924_44_full.jpg">

<img id="CityofChicagoMunicipalTub1-4_1917-1924_44" class="transparent" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/CityofChicagoMunicipalTub1-4_1917-1924_44.jpg">

<img id="CityofChicagoMunicipalTub1-4_1917-1924_44" class="partially-opaque" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/CityofChicagoMunicipalTub1-4_1917-1924_44_partial.jpg">

The opacity filter will also change images, like this one from Thomas Spees Carrington's *Directions for Living and Sleeping in the Open Air*.<br><br>
<br><br>
## Definition Mouseover<br><br>

Academics tend to love their jargon. Sometimes it can be quite helpful, especially when describing very specific concepts or phenomena. In order to lessen the load for readers, certain terms have been tagged with definitions to help specify why and how they function in the dissertation's argument.<br><br>

Some examples<br><br>

> I often talk about <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourse</b></span> in this dissertation. I also have a problem with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span>.
