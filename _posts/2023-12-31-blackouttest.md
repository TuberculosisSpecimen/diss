Hi Kalani!

I don't have a good piece of text for doing the opacity over text, so this is a stand-in for you to test.

This is a comment about tuberculosis' doctors. This is a comment about a patient and how they were treated. I want to describe a specific case here: <span class="opaque-lines"><span class="partial-lines">John Doe suffered after being treated with artificial pneumothorax.</span></span> Many patients were treated with this method, which involved piping nitrogen into the lung to cause a partial collapse of the cavity. The Henry Phipps institute treated <span class="opaque-lines">over a hundred patients</span> in this way. Lawrence F. Flick once said "those poors".

<span class="opaque-lines"><span class="partial-lines">This is a comment that involves sensitive information of a patient to be described.</span></span>

<span class="opaque-lines">This is a comment that involves general information about a range of patients at a single center.</span>

This is a comment about Lawrence F. Flick, a doctor. <span class="opaque-lines"><span class="partial-lines">He treated Jane Doe on January 1, 1900 with a lot of opium.</span></span>

I disagree with these ideas. Flick was obviously out of his gourd.
