# Making Opaque the Patient: Loss as Critical Methodology in the History of Medicine #

I want to start with three images from the history of tuberculosis; these three pictures are ones I regularly return to when writing, and are ones that help me articulate the kind of useful, productive loss which I argue for today. They come from three different publications in a larger corpus of around 700 textbooks, journals, and government reports made between 1882 and 1926. 

The first is an image of two doctors working in the Chicago Municipal Sanatorium’s pathology lab (fig. 1). Reproduced in the mid-1920’s in a public facing, montly periodical, this picture displays the pathology lab, its contents, and the potentially candid action of two doctors at work. 

<img id=ChicagoPathology" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/items/CityofChicagoMunicipalTub5-_1925-26_520.jpg" alt="Pathology Room of the Research Laboratory" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">

<img id=“ChicagoPathology” src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/item/CityofChicagoMunicipalTub5-_1925-26_520.jpg" alt=“Pathology Room of the Research Laboratory”>

Figure 1. Picture of the pathology lab of the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanatorium. In the foreground are wet tissue specimens presumably taken at autopsy from human patients. Found in Pinner, Max. “The Epidemiology of Tuberculosis” \*City of Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis Sanatarium Bulletin\*, 6(5). (1926). 9.

The second image is of a patient, photographed for use in W. M. Crofton’s \*Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Its Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment\* (fig.2). Found in a short book for the aid of doctors, this image displays visual symptoms of tuberculosis as it appears on the body of a male patient. The diagrams were most likely added after the initial exposure.

Figure 2. A photograph of a man with tuberculosis with drawn material added to the image to aid in the diagnosis of the disease. Found in Crofton, W. M.. \*Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Its Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment\*. (Philadelphia: P. Blakiston's Son & Co., 1917), 16.

<img id="Modorph2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/items/Modorph2.jpg" alt="Modorph2.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">

The final image is from a journal article by George E. Bushnell published in 1919 by the \*American Review of Tuberculosis\* (fig. 3). This specimen is a photograph of the upper lobe of a patient who died of tuberculosis and whose body was mined for useful material at autopsy. As viewers, we are supposed to be able to see the pathological difference between this organ and an idea \*natural\* or \*normal\* organ.

These images have a few things in common: they are photographs, they relate to the scientific discourses around tuberculosis in the early twentieth century, and they all depend on an extractive relationship with the tuberculous patient. This hunk of viscera, expertly dissected and reproduced through photograph was probably originally from the body of a US army soldier who died under the care of the author, who was a doctor affiliated with the military at the time of publishing. The man photographed by Crofton is framed in such a way that his body is the focus, but his gaze seems to signal a disapproval or complete willingness to be framed. And finally, the two doctors who are working studiously in the lab are secondary to the jars of human viscera which have been prominently framed in the foreground. Each of these images, unique as they are, share a unifying thread: they rely on varying levels of extraction and exploitation of human subjects, made made possible by the fuzzy, tenuous ethical standards of medicine in the period prior to the Nuremberg Code,

These images, and the thousands like them which populate the corpus from which my dissertation, \*The Tuberculosis Speicmen: The Dying Body and its Use Against the “Great White Plague”\* are examples of an ethical crisis in the history of medicine. Megan Rosenbloom, writing about a challenge to Eduard Pernkoft’s \*Topographische Anatomie des Menschen\* (also known as \*Pernkopf’s Atlas\*) at the University of California’s Norris Medical Library, provides an apt example of this problem. The challenge was centered around an issue of establishing consent: the subjects whose bodies were used for the illustrations may have been victims of the Nazi regime, and may have been sent to be anatomized without consent after they had been executed. Rosenbloom and her colleagues decided to keep the book, adding a detailed description to the book’s digital catalog information. After describing her decision, Rosenbloom outlines a broader existential crisis for medical librarians, archivists, and museum workers. She writes, “Through the challenge process, it became clear to me that if books have to be removed from a medical library because the bodies depicted in them were obtained through unethical and nonconsensual means, there might not be an anatomical text left on the shelf.”[^fn1] 

In light of historical violence against Black and Indigenous populations in the United States,[^fn2] the egregious mistreatment of the bodies of Saartjie Baartman[^fn3] and Charles Byrne, and the classed violence in the passage of anatomy laws,[^fn4] as well as recent exposés by the Washington Post on the hundreds of human brains kept in the Smithsonian,[^fn5] handwringing at Philadlephia’s Mütter Museum regarding the display of remains with no record of consent,[^fn6] and the high profile arrest of Harvard morgue managers over the selling of human remains,[^fn7] issues of systemic racism, colonialist epistemics, and patient consent remain a huge problem for anyone interested in the history of medicine.

I myself am regularly dazzled by the astonishing spectacle of some of these images, and I choose the images which I suspect will get the most response from my audience. But there is a matryoshka-like problem here: as a scholar of medicine’s visual culture, I need to use images that rely on exploited subjects to make my arguments. Nested in this is a need to pick the most compelling, interesting images to make my point, and then nested within both of these needs is the reality that as an academic I am trading on the reproduction of these images for my own professional benefit. Any argument aside, as much as I claim to be ethical, working toward a more just presentation of the past, I still depend on publishing and on presenting my work.

So what am I to do with these humans, who were photographed, who might have been dissected, and who are so nonchalantly depicted as objects in these photographs?

Leaving these issues for a moment, I want to explain how the ethics of reproduction have been explained to me by experts at Indiana University. In short, I have not applied for approval by IU’s institutional review board (IRB) because as I understand it, 1) the subjects in these images are probably dead, 2) the subjects in these images are probably impossible to identify and thus any repercussions of these images on the family members of the deceased would be minimal, and 3) these images were produced prior to the boundaries for HIPPA. My understanding may be wrong (again I have not actually applied for IRB approval), but the research protections codified by my home institution have little interest in the care of the long dead.

The problem is a two-fold one: first, the imagined violence against a human subject after their death assumes that posthumous interference is ultimately not a problem for that subject. They are dead. And while as an agnostic myself I can understand the value of this sentiment, I also have some reservations in just assuming that the treatment of the dead has no repercussions for specific groups, especially as professionals undermine religious, communal, or cultural understandings of the posthumous body in favor of one that enables the continued use of human tissues in the history of medicine. If the mistreatment of remains was not an issue, then there would be no need for NAGPRA (the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act), and no need to return thousands of human specimens from dozens of institutions to their respective communities.[^fn8]

The second problem goes hand in hand with the critiques of medical and anthropological collections by Indigenous scholars and activists: in many cases the act of creating specimens from human remains involved an anonymizing and objectifying process that decultured, dehistoricized, and dehumanized the subject from which they were drawn. Take the lung photographed for Bushnell: the upper lobe of the lung is foregrounded in such a way as to present an objectively neutral presentation of the object, and in the process the identifying information about the patient is lost. Kim TallBear [!!!add a quote from her book]. The anonymization of the original subject through the processes of extraction and objectification of their biomatter remains a significant process in the production of value from the bodies of othered individuals.[^fn9]

The other side, of course, is that the history of these materials might be lost if we start doing away with them. Especially in a moment where fascist organizations in the United States have been combatting the teaching of particular kinds of history, a push to divest human material (important for the history of medicine) can read like an attack on the kinds of history which can be told. This argument, however, feels a bit weak, because while medical historians work with specimens, and I myself am writing a dissertation on these materials, most of the research is more dependent on written, archival material and not the fleshy preserved organs which may or may not be accessible. The practices of anonymization render the objects as seemingly ahistorical, even if their context in collections, published volumes, and other moments where they can be tied to keep some of their provenance.

From this, I want to ask a question: for museum professionals, historians of science, and others who work with stolen biomatter, what does your work look like without relying on the spectacular material stolen from human subjects?

To respond to this question, I want to meditate, briefly on loss. This conference is, after all, about losers and the power of loss, and what I want to stress is a multifaceted understanding of this loss: we have a series of losses suffered by ailing subjects: loss of health, of life, of bodily autonomy (in life and after death), loss of significant body parts; and we have the spectre of potential loss shared by the epistemic communities interested in health and its history. But what is lost if we extend some semblance of dignity back to the patients in the material?

My dissertation attempts to do this through the engagement with and literalization of Eduard Glissant’s notion of “opacity”. Glissant, an afro-carribean poet and philosopher, describes opacity in relation to Western knowledge practices that rely on complete understanding and control. The obsession with the root of a phenomenon, the desire to “grasp” (and thus enclose) a subject, brings with it a totalitarian relationship between the researcher and subject: within these understandings, there is no essence that cannot be examined or understood. Opacity, for which Glissant clamors, is an ethics of personal refusal: a way for the individual to resist the totality of Western knowledge systems by disallowing access and quantification.[^fn10]

My work builds on Glissant’s to consider what happens if we extend opacity to research subjects of the past, and if we produce workflows that are sensitive toward the exploitation of subjects common to medicine prior to the establishment of informed consent? In this vein, I have worked to create a digital platform for the dissertation that literalizes Glissant’s ideas in my argument, to see what an opaque history of medicine might look like, to ask what is lost when parts of medical history are puropsely obfuscated with respect to patients’ bodies.

The dissertation platform functionalizes opacity in two ways and at three levels. The two functions are opacity filters for images and text: images will become more and more difficult to discern based on the filtering level, and there will be portions of text which are redacted in the argument as users increase the filtering. The three levels of opacity are marked as “non-opaque” “partial” and “opaque” and are defined as follows:

1. Non-opaque adds no filtering whatsoever to the images or text. It is just as I have written them.

1. Partial opaque applies opacity in such a way as to protect the privacy of the patient, but keeps the scientific information gleeaned from the subject in tact. This corresponds with contemporary norms regarding privacy and images.[^fn11]

1. Finally, full opacity takes into consideration that the subject probably didn’t consent in the first place, and erases all index of the body (direct or indirect) from the image itself.

Returning to the three photographs I started this paper with, what happens when I apply these levels of opacity to the image?

What strikes me, though, is that the loss of the image, as I continue to black out and flatten what might be a spectacular kind of imagination of the human body, is that I do not see much \*loss\* in the kinds of arguments I can make with these images. What is \*lost\* in fact is a knowledge enriching \*praxis\*. The process of making these images opaque, and the bespoke moments of erasure which comes with the use Adobe Photoshop’s polygonal lasso tool, gives me time to meditate on the images themselves. As the unnamed narrator of Chris Marker’s \*San Soleil\* argues, “[c]ensorship is not the mutilation of the show, it is the show. The code is the message. It points to the absolute by hiding it.”[^fn12] The final products, too, give me a way to frame out the object of the discourse and through this erasure see the implicit arguments in stark relief.

This argument, however, points to a useful problem, one which a contemporary critique of past research ethics helps point to: even with all of my handwringing, my careful intervention, I still rely on the bodies of others in my arguments. In challenging the necessity of these materials, my end goal is to think of processes where communities of knowledge workers can process the bulk of material in ways that prioritizes and respects the lives of the humans rather than seeing these objects as containing knowledge that just needs to be tapped, reaped, plundered, or extracted. 

I am not asking for an entire erasure of the medical library, the medical museum, or the medical archive, but I am calling for a considered approach to divesting unethically sourced material precisely because these materials reproduce and reify the same epistemic practices that enabled the first abuse. Where, in the case of photographs, this approach may be moot, but in the cases of human remains---like the remains of those kileld in Philadelphia’s MOVE bombing, like the blood biomatter kept chilled for decades for racist research programs, like the hundreds of subjects whose remains bare no provenance of consent at the Mütter Museum---my  hope is to imagine ways of articulating these materials in ways that call into question their very utility, that undermines the ways they produce popular spectacle and scientific argument.  Rather than enshrine the very practicess and people that turned those humans into objects, my hope is for a medical archive and museum that begins with the care for and attention to humans who lived and died. 

Thank You.
