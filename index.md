Welcome to *The Tuberculosis Specimen*!

This dissertation is many things: it is an examination of scientific practices around tuberculosis research at the turn of twentieth century; it is a rumination on the ethics of doing research in the history of medicine; and it is a methods dissertation examining the possibilities of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Practice-based research refers to methodologies that entwine various non-lingual, non-theoretical approaches to answer research questions. Arts-based and design-based research both fit under the umbrella of practice-based research."><b>practice-based research</b></span> in humanistic fields.

As this dissertation deals with many sensitive topics, I wanted to have a content warning before accessing the argument directly. 

Some sensitive topics that are in this dissertation include:

* Non-<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the phrase 'consent' to refer to the idea of informed consent: that a research subject needs to be aware of what will happen to them in a research project, and that they have the ability to say 'no' at any point during the research program."><b>consensual{end} medical research practices.
* Depiction of human remains.
* Discussion of systemic racism and ableism, especially related to eugenics.
* Discussion of death and dying.
* Depiction of humans in sensitive and compromising positions.

Some of these concepts are addressed in argument, and some are depicted in the images. For those who are, perhaps, a bit more squeamish regarding human remains or human subject research, I would recommend clicking the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span> button at the top left of each page, to black out the human remains depicted in sections. (More information can be found in the siteâ€™s How to Use this Site page.)

Please skip any sections that may cause emotional distress. This dissertation was built to be engaged non-linearly. Ideas are introduced in multiple places, so as to afford understanding for as many readers as possible.

Thank you for taking the time to read this project.
