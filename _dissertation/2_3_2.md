Throughout this dissertation, I have articulated the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> as something that is <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Social construction refers to a philosophical approach to ontology and epistemics, where human understandings of phenomena are dependent on a social agreement regarding how that phenomenon is interpreted."><b>constructed</b></span>, something that is framed, something that is used to articulate an argument.

The patient’s history is treated in the same manner: only the important parts matter and everything else can be allowed to slough down the drain (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_3}}">2.2.3</a>).

The reduction of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research. The 'subject' is a pun on the monarchal subject, someone who has no agency under the spectacular power of the sovereign. In this relationship, the researcher has power over their research subject to define and describe the person within a set knowledge system."><b>subject</b></span> is a necessary function, partly because it focuses the creation of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research.

Reduction distills concrete elements, and with that, something which can be known in isolation. Botanist and Indigenous scholar Robin Wall Kimmerer summarizes this reduction, writing,

>I did learn another language in science, though, one of careful observation, an intimate vocabulary that names each little part. To name and describe you first must see, and science polishes the gift of seeing. I honor the strength of the language that has become a second tongue to me. But beneath the richness of its vocabulary and its descriptive power, something is missing, the same something that swells around you and in you when you listen to the world. Science can be a language of distance which reduces a being to its working parts; it is a language of objects. The language scientists speak, however precise, is based on a profound error in grammar, an omission, a grave loss in translation from the native language of these shores.[^fn2]

For Kimmerer, who uses sciences as a contrast to the language of her people, the Potawatomi, to describe how central animism is for communicating in their culture. The separation of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research.

What is important for <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathology</b></span> is that the reduction from singular <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research.

It is not a patient’s lung, it is tuberculosis of the lung as it presents in a certain context. The distillation simplifies into a single representation that is decidedly unique: it is collectable, valuable, and useful (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4}}">0.1.4</a>).

This process of creation emphasizes the description and representation of a naturally occurring phenomena. While some arms of medical knowledge, like physiology, focuses on experimental science, where phenomena are reduced and reproduced, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathology</b></span> at the turn of the twentieth century is more descriptive: it collects samples and finds its arguments in the aggregate.
