In 1905, a man was lying in a hospital bed at the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia, slowly dying of meningeal tuberculosis. His death was documented, but his identity was stripped from the record, so I only know him as “Case No. 3440”.[^fn1] His death was documented in fragmented ways, starting with a family and personal history:

><span class="opaque-lines"><span class="partial-lines">Two sisters had died of pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had had the usual diseases of childhood; pleurisy sixteen months ago; and gonorrhea five years ago. He had had pulmonary tuberculosis for the last sixteen months, and presented milliary involvement of the entire right lung and of the upper lobe of the left lung.</span> The pulmonary condition advanced during the two months at the Institute, with, however, gradual reduction in temperature, which varied between 101° and 102°F. The examination of the urine showed acidity, specific gravity Ioz2 (sic), a slight trace of albumin, no sugar, diazo reaction positive, and a few granular and wax-like casts. The patient had two slight hemorrhages, one on July 12th and one on July 24th.</span>

><span class="opaque-lines">Dover's powder had been administered on August 1st. On August 2nd he had convulsions, Jacksonian in type, beginning in the left arm. He did not complain of headaches, and rested in fairly good condition until August 3rd, when he had another convulsion. On August 4th there is a record of four convulsions; on August 5th, seven; August 6th, nine; August 7th, thirty-seven; August 8th, fifty; August 9th, fifteen; August 10th, twenty-five, and August 11th, thirty. On August 7th complete paralysis of the right arm and leg developed, with complete loss of power in the right face.</span>[^fn2]

3440’s case is broken apart into a list of observations: patient history and family history, with specific interest in past disease. This is also a history of tuberculosis in the man’s body, its gains and retreats, with documented changes in weight, temperature and urine acidity. Catalogued in this documentation are symptoms---hemorrhages, seizures, paralysis---which advance in seriousness until they abruptly end when the patient dies. After the narrative of decline, an autopsy is described: 

>The notes of the examination are as follows:

>“<span class="opaque-lines">The patient is conscious, understands what is said to him, and obeys simple commands, such as protruding the tongue, closing the eyes, lifting the arm, etc. He is able to repeat simple words, such as ‘yes’ and ‘no,’ but is unable to hold articulate conversation. The right arm and leg are completely paralyzed and flaccid. The left arm and leg have apparently normal power. The knee-jerk on the paralyzed side is present and quick and weak. There is no ankle clonus on either side. The Babinski reflex is present on the right side. There is some hyperesthesia of the right side. Flexing the arm or the leg produces pain. The pupils are unequal, both more than middle wide, and the left larger than the right. There is no rigidity of the muscles of the neck to-day (slight rigidity was noted in the examination on August 8, 1905). Immediately after the examination the patient had a convulsion which began with slight moaning and clonic jerkings beginning in the right hand and extending rapidly to the face and leg of the right side. The head was turned to the right and the right eye was closed by a clonic spasm of the orbicularis. Both eyes were rotated to the right. During the convulsions he placed his left hand on the twitching mouth. There is some question as to whether consciousness was entirely lost on account of this movement. There were slight twitchings of the muscles of the face. He responded to simple commands immediately after the convulsive movements ceased. If consciousness was lost, it was only momentary. In an attempt to close the eyes in response to a command immediately after a convulsion, the right eye did not close entirely, showing some weakness.</span>

>“<span class="opaque-lines">The diagnosis rests between a localized infiltrating tuberculous lesion confined to the left hemisphere, cerebral hemorrhage, and uremia. The history of the onset points to uremia. The examination of the urine at this time showed only a slight trace of albumin, specific gravity Io26. The mental condition, pulse, and general examination are also against the diagnosis of uremia. The onset, the mental condition, and the localized convulsions are against the diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, and therefore in favor of a diagnosis of a localized inflammatory infiltrating tuberculous process of the left cerebral hemisphere.</span>”[^fn3]

What interests me about this case study is the way it depicts a history. I use the term ‘history’ to note the connection between the term in medical diagnosis---the ways familial illness, and a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

>Is it possible to exceed or negotiate the constitutive limits of the archive? By advancing a series of speculative arguments and exploring the capacities of the subjunctive . . . in fashioning a narrative, which is based upon archival research, and by that I mean a critical reading of the archive that mimes the figurative dimensions of history, I intended both to tell an impossible story and to amplifying the impossibility of its telling.[^fn4]

I think about 3440, and the way he died in a hospital bed while doctors and nurses tended to him, taking notes as they cared for him. I think about the way he died and how the information that is valuable to medical research is so incongruous with the lived experience of death (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_4">2.2.4</a>). It reads as a line of symptoms, an apathetic written record of a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

I use 3440’s history to describe in detail something I have been gesturing toward in this chapter, and which is central to this case study: that in order for the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid.

It is scientifically convincing to discuss the decline of patients with meningeal tuberculosis---a fast moving manifestation of a <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection which affected the brain and was colloquially called “galloping tuberculosis”---and then display, some pages later a brain of a patient who died of meningeal tuberculosis (fig. 1).

The starkness of this narrative, which boils 3440’s death into 807 words in total,[^fn5] shows in part medicine’s reductionism,[^fn6] and with it, the aspects of the patient’s history which are deemed valuable for further research: the symptoms tied to the case history are in turn related to the embodied <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> evidence found at autopsy.

The individualistic approach to analysis in this case history is striking, partly because of the ways this narrative circumvents identification.[^fn7] Michel Foucault, in <i>Discipline and Punish</i>, describes the ‘case’ as a function of the individualizing power of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge.

It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge. Disciplining is a process where certain phenomena are made understandable through demarcation and definition in an academic field."><b>discipline[^fn9]</b></span>---the case functions as a technology that produces discrete units of analysis:

>The examination as the fixing, at once ritual and ‘scientific’, of individual differences, as the pinning down of each individual in his own particularity . . . clearly indicates the appearance of a new modality of power in which each individual receives as his status his own individuality, and in which he is linked by his status to the features, the measurements, the gaps, the ‘marks’ that characterize him and make him a ‘case’.[^fn10]

Foucault’s approach to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge.

The case distills relevant information: 3440’s symptoms---embodied and aberrant events that signal the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathology</b></span>---are narrated as a progression, but the agent seems both present and absent, a figment or a haunting.[^fn11] Important for this pathological-clinical method is that the value is projected at the recognition of symptoms (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4">0.1.4</a>): if there is something abnormal occurring within their body---abnormal specifically in the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> sense, insomuch as it signals embodied difference (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_2">2.1.2</a>)---then there is merit to documenting and collecting the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use this term, 'material', to connect my thinking to new materialism, a philosophical posthuman approach which sees nonhuman agents in the world as having distinct agencies.
