The design work of the Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP) was guided by a skepticism toward the humanistic pregivens of a digital humanities (DH) or health humanities project (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_2">4.1.2</a>). Both of these disciplines see humanity as an assumed universal category, largely ignoring the structural ways humanist and technocultural practices have othered subaltern perspectives in their practices, technologies, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

>One of the essential features of the black digital humanities, is that it conceptualizes a relationship between blackness and the digital where black people’s humanity is *not* a given. The black digital humanities probes and disrupts the ontological notions that would have us accept humanity as a fixed category, an assumption that unproblematically emanates in the digital realm. The black digital humanities, then, might be defined as a digital episteme of humanity that is less tool-oriented and more invested in anatomizing the digital as both progenitor of and host to new---albeit related---forms of racialization.[^fn2]

Gallon’s essay also articulates digital projects as a kind of “technology of recovery”, which especially focuses on digital archives as sites to contest the imagined centrality of white, colonizer perspectives and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

The OOPP affords some of this digital memory making,[^fn3] but it also shows the affordances of creating tools that are built from a critique of universalist, colonialist, white supremacist humanism.

What is important to remember is that scandals like the Tuskegee syphilis study were not aberrant phenomenon in the practice of medical science, but part of an everyday practice that was accepted and codified (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_4">4.1.4</a>). The systems that are designed to protect patients currently, like an institutional review board (IRB), often are there to protect universities from legal recourse.[^fn7] The potential for knowledge always supersedes the needs and desires of a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

>We are far from the opacities of Myth or Tragedy, whose obscurity was accompanied by exclusion and whose transparency aimed at “grasping.” In this version of understanding the verb to *grasp* contains the movement of the hands that grab their surroundings and bring them back to themselves. A gesture of enclosure if not appropriation.[^fn8]

For many researchers, like George E.

My framework builds on the archival platform Muruktu, and the work of archivist Kimberly Christen. Describing the libertarian cyber-utopian <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

Christen argues, 

>Conjuring a sense of information passed down through generations easily washes over other, more dubious ways that ‘we have inherited from the past,’ making the process seem natural and necessary without tainting it with colonial conquests or racist research agendas that pushed scientific exploration and collection practices.[^fn10]

This is especially important to Christen, as she worked to develop the platform *Muruktu* to close access to objects based on Indigenous needs and traditions.[^fn11] The theft---from body parts, to relics, to images of rituals[^fn12]---practiced by knowledge workers is both disturbing in its scale, and in the ways contemporary institutions fight to maintain ownership of these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.

Indigenous activists have struggled, even after the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990, to reclaim the material and knowledge stolen from their communities. Christen continues, 

>What is not generally discussed is the vast store of materials in Western museums, archives, libraries, and personal collections that were not *voluntarily* given, and would not generally meet the standards of prior informed consent. The colonial collecting history of Western nations is comfortably forgotten in the celebration of freedom and openness that would give ‘us’ a storehouse of materials for the common good. In fact, the commons was never a place of inclusion, nor was it ever unregulated or uncontrolled.[^fn13]

Christen’s ideas provide the central framework which guides the Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP): <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

[^fn4]: A great example of how an individual is not seen as being unable to consent can be found in the ways Henrietta Lacks was treated by her doctor while she died of cervical cancer. She was not privy to information about her disease, or the treatment she underwent.
