The design work of the Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP) was guided by a skepticism toward the humanistic pregivens of a digital humanities (DH) or health humanities project (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_2}}">4.1.2</a>). Both of these disciplines see humanity as an assumed universal category, largely ignoring the structural ways humanist and technocultural practices have othered subaltern perspectives in their practices, technologies, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

>One of the essential features of the black digital humanities, is that it conceptualizes a relationship between blackness and the digital where black people’s humanity is *not* a given. The black digital humanities probes and disrupts the ontological notions that would have us accept humanity as a fixed category, an assumption that unproblematically emanates in the digital realm. The black digital humanities, then, might be defined as a digital episteme of humanity that is less tool-oriented and more invested in anatomizing the digital as both progenitor of and host to new---albeit related---forms of racialization.[^fn2]

Gallon’s essay also articulates digital projects as a kind of “technology of recovery”, which especially focuses on digital archives as sites to contest the imagined centrality of white, colonizer perspectives and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

The OOPP affords some of this digital memory making,[^fn3] but it also shows the affordances of creating tools that are built from a critique of universalist, colonialist, white supremacist humanism.

Glissant writes,

>We are far from the opacities of Myth or Tragedy, whose obscurity was accompanied by exclusion and whose transparency aimed at “grasping.” In this version of understanding the verb to *grasp* contains the movement of the hands that grab their surroundings and bring them back to themselves. A gesture of enclosure if not appropriation.[^fn8]

<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>Opacity</b></span> contradicts this mode of capture, imagining a form of knowledge work that is not bound by a desire to control.

For many researchers, like George E. Bushnell, the organs taken from bodies seemed more useful in describing their own ideas about the disease, rather than working in a scientific observation-experimentational method (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_3_1}}">2.3.1</a>). Material in bulk seems more <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

Even if it is all IRB approved, there is a kind of expansive capture that makes me uneasy, mostly because those who benefit from the production of data are the knowledge workers, whose jobs, promotions, and notoriety is most at stake.[^fn9] That data, once it becomes ingested into a form legible for scientific study, becomes something that has potential value, a potential value that seems unquantifiable and must be protected at all costs (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4}}">0.1.4</a>).

My framework builds on the archival platform Muruktu, and the work of archivist Kimberly Christen. Describing the libertarian cyber-utopian <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

Christen argues, 

>Conjuring a sense of information passed down through generations easily washes over other, more dubious ways that ‘we have inherited from the past,’ making the process seem natural and necessary without tainting it with colonial conquests or racist research agendas that pushed scientific exploration and collection practices.[^fn10]

This is especially important to Christen, as she worked to develop the platform *Muruktu* to close access to objects based on Indigenous needs and traditions.[^fn11] The theft---from body parts, to relics, to images of rituals[^fn12]---practiced by knowledge workers is both disturbing in its scale, and in the ways contemporary institutions fight to maintain ownership of these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research.

Indigenous activists have struggled, even after the passage of the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990, to reclaim the material and knowledge stolen from their communities. Christen continues, 

>What is not generally discussed is the vast store of materials in Western museums, archives, libraries, and personal collections that were not *voluntarily* given, and would not generally meet the standards of prior informed consent. The colonial collecting history of Western nations is comfortably forgotten in the celebration of freedom and openness that would give ‘us’ a storehouse of materials for the common good. In fact, the commons was never a place of inclusion, nor was it ever unregulated or uncontrolled.[^fn13]

Christen’s ideas provide the central framework which guides the Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP): <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.
