>And ready-witted Prometheus he bound with inextricable bonds, cruel chains, and drove a shaft through his middle, and set on him a long-winged eagle, which used to eat his immortal liver; but by night the liver grew as much again everyway as the long-winged bird devoured in the whole day.[^fn1]

Prometheus, Grecian titan, was punished for a series of tricks he played on Zeus. First told in Hesiod’s *Theogony*, the “trick at Mecone” involves an arranged meeting between humans and the gods, to determine how sacrifices were to be divided. Prometheus, slaying an ox and arranging its remains two piles---one of the ox’s meat and the other its bones and fat artfully arranged---invited Zeus to choose one of the offerings. When the Olympian chose the pile of bones, he realized that he had been tricked. As an act of retribution, Zeus stole fire from humans, only for Prometheus to steal it back with a fennel stalk. The titan was punished for his transgressions, impaled on a rock and left for an eagle to eat his liver every day, before the hero Heracles slew the beast.

I start with this narrative to develop a metaphor of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>. In Grecian myth knowledge---fire---depends on the embodied punishment of its progenitor---Prometheus. Humans can learn, grow, develop technology, and create art all in relation to this act of punishing. Fire is a gift, one which was given selflessly, and for the benefit of the receiver (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_5">0.1.5</a>). Without fire, human ingenuity would be impossible, and thus humans bare a debt to Prometheus and his transgressions. Knowledge is bound to the titan’s torture.
