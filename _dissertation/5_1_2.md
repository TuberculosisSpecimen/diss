I have repeatedly argued that western academic practices are colonial practices.[^fn1] To produce an argument, scientists needed to take a phenomenon and stage it in an environment where it could be seen as natural.[^fn2] The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods. It combines knowledge from a range of scientific disciplines, like biology, chemistry, physiology, pathology, as part of its evidence-based and causal claims."><b>biomedical</b></span> <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> requires an extraction from the body of a patient, which is made legible through various modes of mediation, technical skill, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

This dissertation has taken umbrage with this process, noting how the beneficiaries of these practices are rarely the people or communities who are seen as a resource.[^fn3] Moreover, this theft is not unique for medical researchers. It also exists for most researchers working in the western academy, and in the global university system. The production of new arguments depends on a steady flow of new materials captured by various methods and framed within a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge. Disciplining is a process where certain phenomena are made understandable through demarcation and definition in an academic field."><b>discipline’s</b></span> <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discourses</b></span>.

As I conclude this project, I want to ask a simple question: why does the academy need to take these materials at all? Certainly, there is a colonial will to capture, destroy, and control the other,[^fn4] but entwined in that is a deeply capitalistic undercurrent. Just as capitalism imagines new economies, consumers, and resources, there is no end to knowledge, nor is there an end to its expansion.[^fn5] There is only a promise of more knowledge.

Thomas Khun wrote about scientific revolutions: his logic posited that eventually one <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Paradigm, as it is defined by Thomas Kuhn, refers to an academic agreement about scientific theories."><b>paradigm’s</b></span> conceptual issues, which emerged in experimentation, would prove too messy and illogical for that framework to continue to succeed. A new model, a new <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Paradigm, as it is defined by Thomas Kuhn, refers to an academic agreement about scientific theories."><b>paradigm</b></span>, would force a change, even if that model had issues which would need further appraisal.[^fn6]  Important for Khun’s ideas is that a new paradigm brings with it a new opportunity for what he calls ‘<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Normal science describes the process of doing research after a new paradigm has been developed in a knowledge field. It does not create new scientific paradigms, but applies the new framework to different research objects and new arenas."><b>normal science</b></span>’. This is a process of testing the postulates of the new paradigm in every applicable space. For example, if tuberculosis is a microbe that can live throughout the body, then there should be research to see whether other diseases, like Pott’s disease, might be caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* in the organ. A new <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Paradigm, as it is defined by Thomas Kuhn, refers to an academic agreement about scientific theories."><b>paradigm</b></span> is a new opportunity to examine old work: to reimagine the causes of a phenomenon within the new model.

Khun’s work is positivistic: scientific revolutions are caused by an engagement with the natural world, which will eventually win out. Curiously, he does not seem interested in thinking of an end to a cycle of revolutions: every theory is limited and prone to issue. The revolutions cannot stop, for there will always be more specific, careful frameworks through which to think about the world.

Khun did not have the capacity to talk in terms of culture. His model cannot answer how science has historically been an exclusionary system. Certainly, in media studies, or cultural studies, or science and technology studies (STS), there can be a narrative of revolutions. The postmodern turn in French philosophy, or the cultural turn of the Birmingham School, the writing of Michel Foucault, or Edward Said, or Judith Butler, or Bruno Latour, producing their ripples and shifts in the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discourse</b></span>. A limitation, at least in the context of humanistic study, is that the revolution never does away with a framework entirely so much as add a new analytical lens.

For all of these revolutions---Khun’s or those in the humanities---there is a shared commonality: they afford the publication of a tide of new scholarship. These revolutions continually provide a new arena for scholars to explore, examine, collect, and distribute. For example, Bruno Latour and his colleagues rightfully charged sociology to look at the sciences themselves. There is a political valence to their work, but there is also a colonial and capitalistic one: if scientists were not seen as a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.
