At the center of Koch’s work are two <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span> underpinnings: first, is the expression of Koch’s postulates---a logical framework that helps prove the presence of bacteria in a given sample. And second, is a representational practice that supports and confirms these ideas. 	The second underpinning is, for this chapter what I most care about, but it is worth discussing Koch’s postulates in some detail. They are quite famous in the history of germ theory, and one of the reasons why medical scientists revere Koch’s contributions. To prove the presence of bacteria,

>It was necessary to isolate the bacilli from the body; to grow them in pure culture. . . : and, by administering the isolated bacilli to animals, to reproduce the same morbid condition which, as known, is obtained by inoculation with spontaneously developed tuberculous material.[^fn1]

Koch’s postulates stress the isolation of a single variable---the bacteria in question---which can be traced from one sick subject through a series of environmental changes. The bacteria is isolated and then followed from a sick <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject here refers to an animal subject, but one which fits within the power schema between researcher and the thing researched."><b>subject</b></span> to a non-contaminated sample and to a healthy <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject here refers to an animal subject, but one which fits within the power schema between researcher and the thing researched."><b>subject</b></span>, who then became sick with tuberculosis. Koch specifically used laboratory animals for this research, relying on guinea pigs as the seat of his bacteriological experiments. This process required infecting these test <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject here refers to an animal subject, but one which fits within the power schema between researcher and the thing researched."><b>subjects</b></span> and letting them die, so that they may be autopsied for tubercules, and the bacteria within (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_4}}">2.1.4</a>).

With Koch’s postulates there is a conceptual and theoretical grounding for the work in the paper, but there is a bigger issue: the German bacteriologist was working to convince a group of his peers---the hostile scientists of the German academy---of the legitimacy of germ theory. To address potential concerns, Koch presented his essay with two hundred prepared demonstrations.[^fn2] These demonstrations showed the process of his work, and let his colleagues examine first-hand to the validity of the research. He showed his research step-by-step: the visible <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathology</b></span> of tuberculosis found in lab animals at autopsy, which correspond to the presence of bacterial colonies in the sterilized serum---itself a visual representation of the isolated germ (fig. 1)---and the resulting materials extracted from animals injected with the isolated serum.[^fn3] 

What I want to stress here is Koch’s reliance on external <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research. An object is a non-human thing that a researcher can define or characterize within a disciplinary field or discourse."><b>objects</b></span>, and the obvious visibility in these transformations. *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* may be traced by symptoms between one test animal and another, but there is always a visual register that confirms its presence: either in the slow growth of a bacterial colony in pure culture which can be spotted by the naked eye, or by the obvious presence of the bacteria when dyed inspected under the microscope (figs. 1 -2) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3}}">2.1.3</a>).

For the specimen to function in Koch’s research, there is an embodied <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use this term, 'material', to connect my thinking to new materialism, a philosophical posthuman approach which sees nonhuman agents in the world as having distinct agencies. Material broadly refers to the complex lives of nonhuman-- things and their interactions in the world.""><b>material</b></span> history: an observer is assumed to be able link the continuity between a series of guinea pigs, the bacteria which propagated inside them, which was cultured in isolation, reintroduced to new guinea pigs, and then displayed again upon their death (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_4}}">2.1.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_4}}">2.2.4</a>). The proof is dependent on an interconnected history, which is distilled in concrete moments of visual examination. Koch’s proof rests not only the intricately dyed *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* which bloom under the microscope (fig. 3-4) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3}}">2.1.3</a>), but also on a continuity between observable phenomena which tie together a narrative of experiment.

The kind of experimental and rhetorical apparatus which Koch deployed corresponds with the approach to the sciences described by Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer in *Leviathan and the Air-Pump*, where the political sphere is dispelled in a scientific demonstration, so that only the natural <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research. An object is a non-human thing that a researcher can define or characterize within a disciplinary field or discourse."><b>object</b></span> can be inspected and understood.[^fn4] Important here is that Koch’s demonstrations played into an acutely visual realm, relying as he does on the technology of the microscope. In this context, then, the representational practice of acquiring, staining, displaying, and reading examples of the microbial world becomes significant, so as to further underline the logical framework of Koch’s postulates. Each move, from sick animal, to pure sample, to inoculation, to examination, requires an acceptance of, and agreement on, the phenomena that had been produced for the scientific observer.[^fn5]

	I use this quote to point to Daniel’s succinct summary of Koch’s work. Daniel’s monograph helps show a nuance which I am unable to address in this study regarding Koch’s distillation of the work of his mentor, Jacob Henle.

	Moreover as René and Jean Dubos note, Koch “presented records of bacteriological studies on ninety-eight cases of human and thirty-four cases of animal tuberculosis. He inoculated four hundred and ninety-six experimental animals, recovered forty-three pure bacillary cultures, and tested their virulence in two hundred animals.”⁠
