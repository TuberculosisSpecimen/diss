Before I can write about the specific requirements of the photo editing, I need to describe in detail the functionality of the page. I did not have any control or access to the *Epoiesen* site,[^fn1] and so I worked from a less-is-more mindset in developing the essay's web functionality. 

The entire time I had wanted to include some mouseover feature that would change the image, and I had assumed it would work by swapping the images whole cloth.[^fn2] Instead, when fishing around Google for useful code snippets, I learned of sprite functionality in web design.[^fn3] Sprite design, as I understood it then, used a single image that has been cropped to show one part of the image and then, when the proper input is directed, would crop to a different part of the image.

The code I wrote does this for images that are very particularly sized:

    .crop {

        	width: 433px;

    	overflow: hidden;

    }

    .horizcrop {

    	width: 1299px;

    	overflow: hidden;

    }

    .position {

    	object-position:0 0 0 0;

    }

    .position:hover {

    	object-position: -433px;

    }

    .position:active {

    	object-position: -866px;

    }

    .horizposition {

    	object-position:0 0 0 0;

    }

    .horizposition:hover {

    	object-position: -1299px;

    }

    .horizposition:active{

    	object-position: -2598px;

    }

This block of code in the .css file works in concert with the code for embedding the image in a web page’s .html, and the original source also included instructions for *Epoiesen*’s editor: 

        // This is a template for how to input the images uses the DO_Mouseover.css //

    <div class="crop"> // This will crop a portrait orientation image to be 433px in width / / 

    	<img src="Images/Gottheil_IllustratedSkinDiseases_1906_217_Combined.png" width="1299" height="595" alt="" class="position"/> // This points to the image and its basic img settings. The important addition is the class="position", because this will add the mouseover and click function. 

    </div>

    <div class="horizcrop"> //This is the same div class as above, but works for the landscape orientation. //

    	<img src="Images/Darier_TextBookDermatology_1920 59_Combined.png" width="3897" height="595" alt="" class="horizposition"/> //same as before but using the class="horizposition" instead //

    </div>

The way these two pieces of code interact creates the cropped field of view which can only see one third of a total image. When a user mouses over the image---signified in the .css file as “[divclass]:hover”---or clicks on it---“[divclass]:active”---the file is recropped to show a different part of the full image. Importantly, a standard for portrait or landscape images had to be developed separately, because the images had different image widths.

I write this section partly to codify my method (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_3_1">X.3.1</a>), but also to stress a base groundwork for the production of these images: I wanted to create a double transformation---one for the initial mouseover, and a second for a mouse click. I worked on this simple code in tandem with the selection of images for the photo essay.

<div class="style-divider">
 	<div class="line"></div>
</div>

[^fn1]: Although if required, I am sure the editor of the journal, Shawn Graham would have made arrangements.

[^fn2]: An interesting note here is that the dissertation website’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> function *actually* does this process of swapping images, but required some Javascript knowledge. I did not have knowledge about this process then (and I still do not know it now).
