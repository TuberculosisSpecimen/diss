One of my goals for the Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP) was to practice a history of medicine as it might be told if medical historians applied contemporary standards of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the phrase 'consent' to refer to the idea of informed consent: that a research subject needs to be aware of what will happen to them in a research project, and that they have the ability to say 'no' at any point during the research program."><b>consent</b></span> back onto historical subjects (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_5}}">0.1.5</a>).

The goal was never to make a wholly <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span> dissertation, but instead to practice how a framework of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span>, applied at different levels, may reveal and negotiate the implicit decisions researchers make regarding how they represent their <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research.

These ideas stem from two material issues from the project’s outset. First, while I am interested in the treatment of human remains, exigencies of the Covid-19 pandemic and a lack of institutional materials available made me pivot toward digitally available materials. Second, these digital artifacts were never owned by me nor by my institution. They are available in the public domain and on [HathiTrust](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=listis&c=441640771%20)---an online consortium of libraries which make their collections digitally available for researchers---meaning that no matter what I do with them in this dissertation, they will remain extant in their digital form.

The OOPP, then, was developed with these limitations in mind: a practice of critical publishing, not archiving. My goal is to point to the very materials I depend on and question their presence in and reproduction from archives, libraries, and digital repositories. What does it mean to reproduce materials which depend on exploitative, colonial modes of conquest and extraction, which prioritized potential knowledge over human <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the phrase 'consent' to refer to the idea of informed consent: that a research subject needs to be aware of what will happen to them in a research project, and that they have the ability to say 'no' at any point during the research program."><b>consent</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_3}}">4.1.3</a>)? How can knowledge workers in the history of medicine reflect on their own collections’ historical exploitations? How can the history of medicine be reimagined from an opaque framework? 

More than reflecting on the ethical issues regarding the reproduction of human <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span> in public-facing work, the OOPP <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The term speculative refers to a broader discussion in history in how to best address structural violence which produces gaps in the archive.

The term has been used by Saidiya Hartman in response to chasms of silence in the archive regarding the lives and deaths of Black subjects.[^fn1] My work builds more on a parallel approach developed by Krista Thompson who practices what she calls “speculative art history” in her work on the mostly forgotten Black minimalist and kinetic light art sculptor Tom Lloyd. Thompson writes,

>Speculative art history entails the refraction of material and archival remains---which are often marked materially by absence, redaction, or disappearance---to highlight histories that might otherwise not come to visibility and the fabulation of art works, careers, or futures that could have been but never came into being. . . . Speculative art history bends the archives or the material remains to produce other ways of seeing, while highlighting factors---archival, disciplinary, social or political---that may hinder or mediate visibility. Refraction (which might be contrasted with reflection) also posits a different relation to knowledge, to the archive and object of study, that rejects the idea of transparency or reflexivity, the understanding (as delineated by Karen Barad) of representations as mirroring the things to which they refer. Speculative art history bends possibilities, paths, and futures.[^fn2]

For Thompson, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The term speculative refers to a broader discussion in history in how to best address structural violence which produces gaps in the archive. Speculative history imagines what might have happened, or otherwise fill in the gap where these violences occurred."><b>speculative</b></span> art history enables an engagement with the objects that were never completed in Lloyd’s career, and they produce a moment to reflect on the history of the artist had he had the resources to document and produce the work; “It offers a history of what might have been had the structures that shape visibility, opportunity, and history had offered Lloyd a platform.”[^fn3] Thompson’s process of doing this history includes the manipulation of photographic evidence to represent the art as it might have been, with an eye toward how and why images are used in art history’s discourses. 

I developed the OOPP to ponder how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The term speculative refers to a broader discussion in history in how to best address structural violence which produces gaps in the archive.

I do not want medicine to continue to harm its <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research.

Much of my in this dissertation attempts to bridge two medium specific <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research.
