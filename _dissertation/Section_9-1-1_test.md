# 1.1.1 Tuberculous Metaphor

Start with a quote from sontag.

Susan Sontag's *Illness as Metaphor* thinks about how patients are treated after being diagnosed with a disease. Written after her own experience with breast cancer, the essay reflects on how isolating and stigmatizing it was to go thorugh chemotherapy treatment in the 1970s [!!!Checkdate]. She thought about the kinds of language which was used around cancer, and the ways the disease was represented in the contemporary discourse. Her essay was, also, a comparative one, using tuberculosis at the turn of the twentieth century as a foil. Tuberculosis which, popularly, was concieved as a wasting disease, for Romantics, poets, artists, who burnt out young, as they frenziedly lost weight until they were left bedridden and on death's door. [!!!addquote?]

Sontag played with popular imaginations of tuberculosis as a foil to the alienation she felt as a cancer patient, and used it to think about how the sick are thought at a cultural scale: cultures make assumptions about people with specific diseases, even outside the hospital. In some ways the essay fits well next to the critiques of Phillipe Ariés, Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, and Cisely Saunders, who penned in the post-war period research that critiqued the medicalization of death (2.1.3).[^fn1] Biomedicine---the dominant medical knowledge system which guides contemporary discourses around health and wellness globally---has been attacked for decades because of its often cruel, ambivalent, and alienating practices, and Sontag's essay, as well as its follow-up essay on the metaphors around AIDS, critiques both the medicalization and isolation of cancer patients, and the stigmas which swirl about the disease that emerge from the biomedical system and from non-medical sources as well.

Tuberculosis is an excellent choice to use as a prop and contrast for Sontag's critique. Not a straw-man by any means, but broad enough, and so present in the public consciousness, even after the advent of antibiotics, to be aware of its history and cultural impact. Tuberculosis always returns, not unlike its recurring infection in the body of a patient, by way of the AIDS crisis, the advancement of drug resistant TB, and global inequities in care. It remains in the public consciousness, both in the recollections of loved ones who have memories of family members with the disease,[^fn2] but also in the ways tuberculosis is leveraged as a exclusion agent. Many of my colleagues who traveled to the United States for school have told me about the mandatory screenings they had to take before they could be allowed in the country.[^fn3] The popular imagination of the disease resides as an afterimage, nestled into discourses of public health, care standards, popular media, and xenophobic debates around immigration. This luminescent remnant was produced as a result of broader cultural, scientific, and governmental forces, which focused around tuberculosis in the late nineteenth century. This was created in equal measure by a change in knowledge around the disease (2.2.0), by the popularization of the sanatorium treatment (1.2.0), by the adoption of germ theory (2.2.0), by the emergence of public health approaches to medicine (1.3.0), and by an active volunteer network fighting to rid the nation of tuberculosis.

This popular and social understanding was informed by, and in turn influenced, the scientific imagination of the disease. I use this term scientific imagination to stress the social construction of health (x.x.x), and to note the cultural influence of the disease prior to Koch's bacteriological studies (2.2.0), when it had been considered a hereditary, wasting disease. For the majority of the nineteenth century, tuberculosis was associated with those with an artistic disposition---the Romantic poet John Keats being the most cited example.[^fn4] Those with the disease were thought to burn bright and fast and be *consumed* over months or years. These conceptions of heredity, as well as ideas regarding a set limit of energy a human had in their lifespan, persisted into the twentieth century, with familial disposition to the disease becoming a central conceit for germ versus soil arguments---where the embodied disposition of a patient was thought to be more important for a tuberculosis infection than *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* itself.[^fn5]

In this context, I would be remiss if I did not address the popular imagination in this dissertation. Tuberculosis looms large in the medical memory, in part due to these cultural influences, and in part due to its ebb and flow as a problem in global health.[^fn6] I also am conscious of my demands of the readers of this dissertation: while they may have lingering memories of the disease, there is a lot of historical and cultural context which an interdisciplinary audience may only be aware of in passing. 

Perhaps most important too is that in the development of the dataset for this dissertation (0.x.x; X.x.x), I found myself inundated with images that did not correspond to my assumptions about medicine's visual culture (1.1.2). I had assumed the majority of images would correspond to the specimen at different scales---cellular images, wet specimens, and full body pathological portraits---and in different media---illustrations, photographs, and x-rays. What I did not expect was that scientific journals also published about sanataria, arguing about the merits of specific floorplans (1.2.4); they promoted their facilities; they gazed at patients, at the poor, at the society in ways that were beyond the remit of the specimen.

This chapter, then, works to foreground the non-specimen images which litter the tuberculosis data set (x.x.x). What does a child selling postage seals (fig. 1), an architectural floor-plan for a sanatorium (fig. 2), an image of a filthy room (fig. 3), images of children studying in heavy coats (fig. 4), and a photograph of a cottage (fig. 5) have to do with the scientific understandings of the disease? What about a photograph of idyllic mountain resort (figs. 6 & 7), a portrait of a doctor taken for a conference (figs. 8 & 9), or a graphic of a flapper dancing with death (fig. 10) have to do with the ways doctors saw and treated their patients?

Early on in my research, I had assumed that scientific medicine was defined by the clinical gaze---a singular way of seeing the sick patient in a way that emphasizes contrasts between a healthy 'normal' anatomy and unhealthy 'abnormal' pathology, resulting in the alienation and objectification of the sick subject (2.1.2). Visual culture scholars like Katherine Waldby, Jose van Djick, Erin O'Connor, and Lisa Cartwright have convincingly articulated the ways clinical visuality has been embraced in practice and in the technologies of medical research and diagnosis, and my assumption was that most of the images in the corpus would correspond with the alienating, dehumanizing clinical gaze and its technological mediation in the clinical photograph.[^fn7] These images, being non-specimen images,[^fn8] were outside the scope of my initial research, but muscled their way in as a prominent practice which deserved attention.

This chapter addresses this surprising observation with a series of questions: what are some of the broader assumptions which encircle the treatment of tuberculosis? How are these reproduced in visual media? How do they display differing visual practices in the history of medicine? And in what ways do these images reinforce the classist, racist, and ableist ideologies in the health sciences?

I ask these questions first because of the implicit connections between tuberculosis research and the other cultural actors producing images. Some of the visual material is closely related to scientific research, as with the cases of material in public-facing magazines published by sanataria with research capabilities (*The Sanatorium* and the first few volumes of *The Journal of Outdoor Life*) (fig. 11). Other materials were linked to public health and volunteer organizations like the Anti-Tuberculosis Health League or the Charity Organization Society of the City of New York, and even more were public-facing books that were meant to help tuberculous patients find sanataria, understand how to treat their loved ones, or provide help about hygiene. Beyond this, even more images came from self published or regionally published materials that may or may not have any association with the broader scientific discourses around the disease (fig. 12).  This broad range of publications speaks also to a wide array of writers and readers. Where a visual practice---like the clinical gaze---may be trained by a majority of the actors in the discourse, many of the other actors---public health officials, volunteers, lay people, and patients---bring their own ideologies, preconceptions, and visual approaches into the discourse.

In this chapter I will wrangle the sometimes disparate threads which knot around the non-scientific representations of tuberculosis in this period. I pursue two arguments: first, in building on the excellent but narrow scholarship by my peers who analyze medicine and its ways of seeing, I stress a need to look at medicine's visual cultures in the plural. Medicine has never practiced a singular visual culture, one overtly defined by the clinical gaze. By opening this discourse to competing, overlapping, contested visual practices, I encourage future scholars to explore the idiosyncratic practices leveraged by medical doctors, patients, and others working in healthcare.[^fn9] Moreover, where this chapter addresses tuberculosis, the cultural landscape which emerged around other diseases---like the AIDS epidemic, cancer research, the 1918 influenza epidemic, or Covid-19---is quite different than the one I describe in this chapter. Future scholarship will help nuance, rebuke, and clarify the claims I make.[^fn10]

To foreground the broader cultures around tuberculosis, I am going to follow three three case studies---on hygiene, the sanatorium, and the medical practitioner at work---to define some ideological through-lines which will reappear in the next chapter (2.0.0). In doing this, my hope is to articulate in clear detail the eugenicist and capitalistic ideas which were reified in the process of fighting the disease. Concepts of class, ability, cleanliness, and health appear in relation to the cultural conception of tuberculosis, as well as the popular and scientific understandings regarding treatment. As Linda Bryder has argued, tuberculosis doctors in the early twentieth century "showed themselves to be very much a product of the middle-class society from which they came, with its fixed assumptions about the poor",[^fn11] and this chapter extends this claim to think about how discourses around the disease, made possible by medical professionals, patients, and the lay public, reinforced these structures. By examining the profusion of gazes which saw tuberculosis, the tuberculous, the sanitarium, and the doctors themselves, this chapter expands and complicates medical vision beyond the clinical (2.1.2).
