In May 2022, I had the opportunity to develop a second installation using a similar three projector setup for the IFell gallery in Bloomington, Indiana.[^fn1] This project, <i>Tuberculous Imaginaries</i>, took advantage of a site specific approach,[^fn2] as well as an increased focus on the history of tuberculosis, which I had adopted as part of my dissertation project in Fall 2021. Much of my preliminary thinking regarding tuberculosis’ <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> were derived while working on this installation (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_2">1.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>).

With three projectors and two walls, <i>Tuberculous Imaginaries</i> used a similar overlapping projector schema for one wall and a single second projector for the other (figs. 1 - 3), and each video feed displayed a specifically curated set of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.

For this installation I attempted to take advantage of an affordance of digital projection: the potential for an uninterrupted durational video feed. I used this to create three videos of differing lengths, which would then project in unique ways over the course of the month-long installation. All of the images were made using materials from the tuberculosis <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="A corpus refers to a collection of texts used for computational analysis."><b>corpus</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_1_1">X.1.1</a>), but I only selected images from twenty-nine sources.[^fn3]  A more thorough description of the method of each projector can be found in the appendix (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_3_1">X.3.1</a>).

Projector A stood on its own, projecting onto the east wall of the IFell’s gallery space. It showed <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> illustrations and clinical photographs (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>) and displayed these images with long durational zooms on the still frame. For the most part, I chose images that might look closer to an abstract composition (figs. 4), but in a few cases I kept figural images in tact (fig. 5).[^fn4]

Projector B showed images of doctors and other medical professionals. One of the things I began to think about after completing <i>Terminal Imaginaries</i> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_1">3.2.1</a>) and “Dermographic Opacities” (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_1">3.3.1</a>) was the way doctors were less prominent in clinical photographs. Sometimes only the hands of the doctor would be in view, and other times one could only see some other restraining apparatus, and I began to wonder about how the medical professionals may be visible in the frame (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_1">1.4.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_2">1.4.2</a>). To examine the ways this <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge.

In this case it the subject lacks agency in relation to the researcher studying them."><b>subjects</b></span> (fig. 7).

Projector B was a unique install, because it was displayed in a portrait style setup.[^fn5] For this video feed, all of the images were produced for the top and bottom of the image, allowing a second video feed from Projector C to be projected through. This feed displayed text from a few chapters of the primary sources, as well as written commentary; the cover of the source was also projected (figs. 7 & 8) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_3_2">X.3.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_3_1">X.3.1</a>).  As I wrote on the project’s website, “[r]ather than enshrine these artifacts as authoritative, concrete specimens, I have taken care to respond to and reflect on the rhetoric employed by medical professionals in their discourses between other scientists and the public.”[^fn6] I used this video feed as an opportunity to read some of the primary materials and try to comment on their assumptions.

[^fn1]: A few thanks are in order for this specific installation. I am indebted to the help of Sydney Stutsman, who helped with the final build, as well as to the entire staff at the Institute for Digital Arts and Humanities---Kalani Craig, Michelle Dalmau, Vanessa Elias, and Pouyan Shahidi.

[^fn4]: I do not know why I kept the last image, because for the most part, I attempted to keep the subjects anonymous. I think I felt at the time that the face was obscure enough, abstract enough to be anonymized. My thinking regarding anonymity has changed quite a bit in the years since its completion.

[^fn5]: One of the biggest problems I encountered, and which Sydney, wo assisted with the install, and I had to address was that the projector, nor the mount were made for this setup. The result was a bit less than professional, with a vaugely ninety degree angle tilt, and issues with the projected frame being distorted.
