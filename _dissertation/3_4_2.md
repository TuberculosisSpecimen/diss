This chapter argues against a progressivist framing of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method. This can include traditional arts like painting, sculpture, or dance, or more complex conceptual or multi-media approaches."><b>arts-based methods</b></span>. I cannot attest that the methods I have outline will improve knowledge work, nor that they will produce better research. My insistence on this point is not to devalue the arts. I produce art. It is a necessary part of my research practice. The previous sections detail how creative projects inform my scholarship.

My reason for this move comes from a more concerted move to deflate the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discourses</b></span> around emergent approaches to knowledge production.[^fn1] Academics, myself included, have a long and storied history of bloviating about the qualities of new methods.[^fn2] Moreover, reflecting on the hype trains of years past, especially from the supposedly ‘disruptive innovators’ in Silicon Valley, I have a hard time seeing revolutionary interventions as being anything but the covert, or overt, machinations of capitalists funding the takeover of an otherwise functioning industry.[^fn3]

My approach to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method. This can include traditional arts like painting, sculpture, or dance, or more complex conceptual or multi-media approaches."><b>arts-based research</b></span> is borrowed from Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar’s second postscript to *Laboratory Life*. They write,

>In the closing section of the original draft we declared that our analysis was “ultimately unconvincing.” We asked our readers of the text to not take its contents seriously, but our original publishers insisted that we remove the sentence because they said, they were not in the habit of publishing anything that “proclaimed its own worthlessness.”[^fn4]

Latour and Woolgar’s claim is worth adopting more generally in scholarship: rather than saying the value of the work, and conscribing actors in defense of a claim,[^fn5] the two science and technology studies (STS) scholars turn their pockets out and invite critique. Their tongue-in-cheek claim is undoubtably one of unbelievable privilege and self-assurance, amended onto the monograph after it was a success, no less, but it is also one inviting continued discussion. 

The kind of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The term tactics comes from the philosophy of Michel de Certeau, and refers to political action taken that has no impact on broader cultural and political struggles."><b>tactical</b></span> <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The term 'parasite' comes from the tripartite ontology argued for by Michel Serres. It refers to systems of being in which things thought in opposition are linked through their dependence on one another."><b>parasitism</b></span> that I described in the previous section (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_4_1}}">3.4.1</a>), is indebted to Latour and Woolgar’s nonchalance, but it is also tied to a broader history of critical theory informed, academically adjacent scholarship employed by tactical media artists, like the Critical Art Ensemble (CAE), RTMark, and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation among others. Working in an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideologically</b></span> slippery and technologically adept mode of practice, these artists tried to leverage the mechanisms and platforms of late stage, neoliberal capital as a space of critique, hacking websites, remaking and redistributing consumer technology, and producing counter cultural installations, performances, and essays. Often these practitioners work in collectives, hoping to disperse authority of their work, pushing for ephemerality in relation to the built infrastructures of information capitalism.[^fn6]

I want to, briefly, look to the work of CAE as a means to outline how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method. This can include traditional arts like painting, sculpture, or dance, or more complex conceptual or multi-media approaches."><b>arts-based research</b></span> informed their work, before folding it back into my argument. A collective of five artists who, beginning with filmic works in the 1980s, became known for various scientifically mediated art pieces. Inspired by the work of cultural theorists Michel de Certeau, Gilles Deleuze and others, these artists have hacked GameBoys, and built antagonistic robots, and performed using lecture-like scientific methods. Their most well-known performance, *Flesh Machine*, addressed the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Eugenics refers to a way of thinking that thinks that human society can bettered by selective reproduction.

CAE’s work is medium ambivalent, choosing instead to work on subject matter and produce artworks that responds to the ways dominant, authoritarian <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideologies</b></span> are part and parcel of that practice. As the artists articulate in an interview,

>CAE begins inquiry by developing an understanding of a given territory using critique to rip at the territory to expose hidden and transparent ideological strata. Then we try to exploit those areas with participatory cultural practice.[^fn9]

As with *Flesh Machine*, CAE often works in the context of scientific capital: in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

In Steve Kurtz’s---one of CAE’s founding members---case, his legal battles with the post-9/11 American justice system was hampered by his lack of a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense.

Reflecting on the movement in 2008, Jean Ray and Gregory Sholette note the ways tactical media artists have productively and problematically eschewed the utopian logic of leftist thought. They write, “[f]or better and for worse, the nomadic agency of [tactical media] corresponds exactly to the de-territorialised spaces of global capitalism.”[^fn10] Moreover, these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The term tactics comes from the philosophy of Michel de Certeau, and refers to political action taken that has no impact on broader cultural and political struggles."><b>tactical</b></span> interventions point to an oblique and undetermined arena of critique, which the explicitly logical is at odds with the theaters of terror exemplified in post-9/11 America. Joan Hawkins, writing of Kurtz and the CAE’s legal battles, notes that while the legal apparatus obviously note the artists’ innocence it seems to be by an illogical force to continue prosecution. The drive of the second Bush administration and the anti-terrorism arms of its justice system, which can conceivably be extrapolated to the various administrations who have held power in the two decades following Kurtz’ initial arrest, is and never was logical, but instead a result of the production of political force.[^fn11] 

For Hawkins, logic and its political antecedents are bound within a broader <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discourse</b></span> of taste, which police how and when and why an artist can make their art public. Also associated with this taste hierarchy are standards by which claims are deemed politically relevant---what can effect social change and what cannot. She writes, 

>[t]hat to mount provocative art---especially art which deals with disaster---when something real IS at stake is somehow in bad taste. And that to raise the question of the politics of taste---the fact that the whole notion of bad taste is itself an ideologically inflected construct---is also intolerable in the face of real crisis.[^fn12]

The policing of art in the post-9/11 moment, and the literal policing of Kurtz and his CAE collaborators, begs to ask the utility of the arts in any moment, especially a moment where a nation state is vulnerable and hurting. Hawkins’ argument ends with a shift in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research. An object is a non-human thing that a researcher can define or characterize within a disciplinary field or discourse."><b>research objects</b></span>, writing that “we need to focus our analytical attention more on processes than on products, but in such a way that logic is not taken to be the defining feature of process”.[^fn13] 

While Hawkins is noting ‘process’ to be an analytical <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research. An object is a non-human thing that a researcher can define or characterize within a disciplinary field or discourse."><b>object</b></span> for cultural scholars, I want to expand this to think in terms of process to analyze process. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The term tactics comes from the philosophy of Michel de Certeau, and refers to political action taken that has no impact on broader cultural and political struggles."><b>Tactics</b></span>, for CAE, operates with an understanding of its own futility. As the artists describe in an interview,

>It should be added that resistant models and processes will never be dominant. Perhaps this is one romantic characteristic that CAE can’t seem to shake. We only believe in temporary solutions, temporary improvement. There is only permanent cultural resistance; there is no endgame. Authoritarian culture won the day on the first day. . . . But there can be spaces and processes within certain moments that can successfully stop the flow of capital, lift the repression, and in so doing, actually allow for the emergence of pleasure and happiness.[^fn14]

Creative <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Praxis, in academic conversations, is often defined in relation to and in opposition against theory.

For me, this creation is then complimented by more traditional scholarship, like “Dermographic Opacities” or this dissertation (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_1}}">3.3.1</a>).
