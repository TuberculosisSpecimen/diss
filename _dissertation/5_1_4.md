As I conclude this project, I do not want to make a claim that all knowledge is useless, or that research should not be done. Knowledge work should continue; after all, that is why I have committed to this labor. I hope my work is valuable to someone for their own thinking.

What I am saying is that the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideological</b></span> and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

For me, that reassessment comes from the context of ethics, and specifically an ethics that is in dialogue with scholars who come from communities that would have been considered a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

This kind of ethics is embedded, contingent, and imperfect.[^fn1]

One of the things that I witness when talking with scholars about ethics, is that they tend to think of it in terms of a check list---‘I can get institutional review board (IRB) approval, and then I do not have to worry about any harms.’ Ethics, for these scholars, is a hoop to jump through, not a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Relationality, as I use it, is indebted to Indigenous knowledge systems.

In this context, should the proper forms be filled out, should the proper precautions be in place, then anything that the researcher does is deemed ethical. This kind of approach is the lowest bar: a necessary step, especially because of what can happen if <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the phrase 'consent' to refer to the idea of informed consent: that a research subject needs to be aware of what will happen to them in a research project, and that they have the ability to say 'no' at any point during the research program."><b>informed consent</b></span> is ignored, but one in which harm is still possible.

Research ethics are about the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Relationality, as I use it, is indebted to Indigenous knowledge systems.

As researchers, we are obligated to care for them,[^fn2] and often caring for someone or something means keeping their secrets.[^fn3] Édouard Glissant’s concept of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> was argued in terms of the individual: someone could <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refuse</b></span> inclusion into a totalitarian knowledge system, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refuse</b></span> the ways those systems reduce, define, and describe their <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

In this case it the subject lacks agency in relation to the researcher studying them."><b>subjects</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3">4.2.3</a>).[^fn4] What I would like to challenge academics to take on is an ethics of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span>. At small scales this can incorporate <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> as a means to deny access to individual, communal, or sacred information that has been shared with scholars.[^fn5] Community-based and public humanities researchers have shown how knowledge workers engaging with communities can assist those groups.[^fn6] <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>Refusal</b></span> is a necessary tool in gaining and maintaining trust in those communities.[^fn7] 

On a larger scale, I want to imagine <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> as a means to short-circuit the capitalistic <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideologies</b></span> which are maintained in our academic systems (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/5_1_3">5.1.3</a>). After watching most of my colleagues graduate and flounder on the academic job market, after watching Indiana University’s (IU) Media School---formed under a guise of cross disciplinary conversation---fight amongst itself regarding supreme epistemic authority, and after watching IU dismantle the Institute for Digital Arts and Humanities (IDAH) and the Center for Research on Race, Ethnicity, and Society (CRRES), I cannot say I have any love for the system in which I write. Moreover, at least in regard to IDAH and CRRES’ stellar record of publications, speakers, graduate students, and impact on the university’s research community in spite of their minuscule budgets, I doubt as to whether the scale of research has anything to do with who gets funding, what organizations get to exist, and who gets to be employable in the academy.

On this larger scale, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> is only possible should it be accepted within the established tenure and promotion guidelines. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>Refusal</b></span> in these guidelines would reward less research, done with kindness and obligation to one’s research interlocutors. It is only possible should those hiring new faculty be willing to fight for junior scholar’s ability to do careful, conscientious research. It is only possible if as a coalition, we scholars can admit to the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideologies</b></span> which are driving our institutions toward the impossibility of infinite growth---more students, more buildings, more grant funding, more campuses, more publications. Even then, faculty voices only speak so loudly, especially when a university’s administration ignores every note, plea, or comment directed by any faculty governing body.

Frankly, I am not in a place to refuse anything, because I have no long-term future in the academic system. I am one of hundreds of scholars who is hungrily reaching for the promise of a tenure track line, and who will, most likely, give up in a year or two after dozens of failed applications. The system will <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refuse</b></span> me.

What I call for is a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> to willingly produce into a system that will devour anyone and everyone for its own expansion, for its own benefit, all the while chewing up the people within---researchers, students, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

At present, I doubt any other version of the academy is possible at all.
