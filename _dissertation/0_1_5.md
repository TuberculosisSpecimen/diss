As I am a cis, heterosexual, settler colonial white man, my understanding of this approach is both limited and biased, so I have chosen to borrow more heavily from the writing of Indigenous scholars to describe this approach themselves.

I am indebted to Shawn Wilson’s book <i>Research is Ceremony</i> for my own understanding of this approach. In the book a research interlocutor and interviewee, Peter, articulates how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Relationality, as I use it, is indebted to Indigenous knowledge systems. Relation refers to the ways researchers become connected to and obligated to the people, ideas, and non-human entities which they study."><b>relationality</b></span> is about connection: 

>It’s collective, it’s a group, it’s a community. And I think that’s the basis for relationality. That is, it’s built upon the interconnections, the interrelationships, and that binds the group . . . but it’s more than human relationships. And maybe the basis of that relationship among Indigenous people is the land. It’s our relationship to the land. There’s a spiritual connection to the land. So it’s all of those things.[^fn3]

This connection to land operates differently than in individualistic European <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideologies</b></span>. As Stan Wilson argues, Indigenous peoples “understand themselves as constituted by their relationships with all living things”, noting its distinction from other <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span> and cultural frameworks tied to the Black diaspora, Eastern religion, and feminist thinking.[^fn4] Shawn Wilson, paraphrasing Stan, summarizes this concept: “Rather than viewing ourselves as being <i>in</i> relationship with other people or things, we <i>are</i> the relationships that we hold and are part of.”[^fn5] This is why the words <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span>, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ontology refers to the study of being in philosophy. I usually avoid the use of this term, because as I read it, ontology is dependent on how one describes and measures the real, which is better described as epistemology."><b>ontological</b></span>, methodological and axiological are used in conjunction with one another when talking about Indigenous research. For these frameworks, beliefs, and practices, “[t]he <i>what</i> is always already a <i>why</i> and a <i>how</i> which is another way to say ‘obligation’”[^fn6]

Doing research from this framework is not about working on something, so much as it is generating a relationship with something and fostering all of the relationships that are bound to it. I do not research <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span> as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.

My acknowledgement and sensitivity toward these connections makes me obligated to these actors. Shawn Wilson, and his interlocutors, argue this as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Relationality, as I use it, is indebted to Indigenous knowledge systems. Relation refers to the ways researchers become connected to and obligated to the people, ideas, and non-human entities which they study."><b>relational</b></span> accountability. As Wilson writes,

>gaining knowledge is more like being married to someone---you don’t own your spouse or children but you do share a special relationship. It is a relationship that you are accountable to. And therefore it becomes cultural appropriation when someone comes and uses that knowledge out of its context, out of the special relationships that went into forming it. You have to build a relationship with an idea or with knowledge, just like you have to with anything or anyone else.[^fn7]

Doing research brings us, scholars, into relationship with our <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin. Object, as I use it, carefully considers how human patients are denied their humanity through transformations that deem them as objects."><b>research objects</b></span>: we cannot be separated from them, as they are bound to us in our attention to and respect toward our research goals. Often when writing this dissertation, when asked what I am working on, I respond with something like “I do work on the history of tuberculosis”, or “I look at the moments when people are turned into research objects in medicine.” From a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Relationality, as I use it, is indebted to Indigenous knowledge systems.

I cannot just do research on tuberculosis; instead, by doing research with the doctors and patients I have an ethical obligation to everyone who co-constitutes my research program. My attention brings with it an obligation to care for and care with these interlocutors, even those who were harming their <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Social construction refers to a philosophical approach to ontology and epistemics, where human understandings of phenomena are dependent on a social agreement regarding how that phenomenon is interpreted."><b>subjects</b></span> in their research (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_4_3">2.4.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3">4.2.3</a>).[^fn8]

Understanding their gift to me, drawing their lives closer to me, makes me obligated not to see these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span> as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.

I have said many times in this introduction that human <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span> were people once. This claim cannot operate within a framework of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.

In this way the goal of the dissertation is to do two things: First, it articulates a series of knowledge claims regarding the history of medicine, drawn as they are through media studies. These claims are made with the explicit intent to describe and detail the entanglement of colonialist, capitalist, and white supremacist <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideologies</b></span> within medical knowledge work.[^fn9] I argue that the entire medical <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span> apparatus is built upon a colonialist will to extract from the bodies of patients (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_3">0.1.3</a>), and that will to extract is part and parcel of the broader medical system: the production of medical institutions (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_3">1.2.3</a>; 1.2;5), the production of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge.

Second, through a process of self-reflective critique (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_2_2">0.2.2</a>), I articulate a broader interrogation of the history of medicine and the humanist approaches to these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideological</b></span> systems. As Eve Tuck has argued, researchers tend to do harm-based research, which assumes that social change is produced through the revealing of harms done to individuals or communities. For Tuck this view reduces how scholars look at communities: in looking for harm they portray these communities as only being harmed, damaged, and in need of aid.[^fn10] I am less interested in the overt harm which has obviously been done in the history of medicine, because that observation has done little to address the systemic problems in medicine. Instead, I work <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term speculative refers to a broader discussion in history in how to best address structural violence which produces gaps in the archive. Speculative history imagines what might have happened, or otherwise fill in the gap where these violences occurred."><b>speculatively</b></span>---a frame borrowed from Saidiya Hartman and Krista Thompson---to imagine what might change if research did not depend on extraction (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_2_2">0.2.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_1">4.2.1</a>).[^fn11]

As scholars, our obligation is to those with whom we research, and this demands that we do more than just theorize and report harms. The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span> systems in which we work are themselves a problem: they have done harm and continue to do harm to their research interlocutors; they continue to produce value for the benefit of colonial institutions that wield their cultural, economic, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

This framing extends and complicates what Harriet Washington has already convincingly argued. The medical system in the United States is one which produces two separate health apparatuses, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

In this case it the subject lacks agency in relation to the researcher studying them."><b>subjects</b></span>, and outcomes. She writes, “the much bewailed racial health gap is not a gap, but a chasm wider and deeper than a mass grave. The gulf has riven our nation so dramatically that it appears as if we were considering the health profiles of people in two different countries---a medical <i>apartheid</i>.”[^fn12] This racist system compounds and exacerbates other modes of racial inequality, while at the same time benefitting the health of the white population.

Washington’s excoriation of America’s medical systems went hand in hand with another critique: of the history of medicine writ large. Before the turn to public histories of medicine in the late twentieth century,[^fn13] the history of medicine was usually told by doctors themselves; the medical libraries which held books that I used for this research were usually made from the donations of doctors who had enough disposable income to collect and preserve rare medical textbooks. The history of medicine has a long history of touting its own values, centralizing its own ‘great men’,[^fn14] and Washington’s monograph showed how that history willfully ignored the harm practiced in the pursuit of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods. It combines knowledge from a range of scientific disciplines, like biology, chemistry, physiology, pathology, as part of its evidence-based and causal claims."><b>biomedical</b></span> progressivism. This dissertation extends this critique to one which includes other disciplines---media studies (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_3">0.1.3</a>), health humanities, digital humanities (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_2">4.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_1">4.2.1</a>), death studies (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_4">2.2.4</a>)---all of which inform different parts of its project, into its meta-critique. So much of the western academic system is built on theft, and as scholars we are obligated to attend to this problem and seek to remedy it.
