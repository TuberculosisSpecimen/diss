This dissertation looks at the ways <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

While there is a great deal of cultural and scientific baggage associated with the disease (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_2}}">0.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_1}}">1.1.1</a>), my interest is much more in the ways scientists <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Social construction refers to a philosophical approach to ontology and epistemics, where human understandings of phenomena are dependent on a social agreement regarding how that phenomenon is interpreted."><b>constructed</b></span> the disease from the bodies of patients.

My framework is indebted to Kim TallBear’s use of Stuart Hall. Writing of the coproduction of science in her book *Native American DNA*, she describes how biological phenomena are encoded in cultural processes. She writes, 

>Rather than being discrete categories where one determines the other in a linear model of cause and effect, ‘science’ and ‘society’ are mutually constitutive---meaning one loops back in to reinforce, shape or disrupt the actions of the other, although it should be understood that, because power is held unevenly, such multidirectional influences do not happen evenly.[^fn2]

TallBear’s argument keys into how race and tribal identity are coded through DNA, pointing to how these discourses are a byproduct of the racial schemas assumed by the researchers studying Indigenous communities.[^fn3] Scientists coproduce a reality, and the racial <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

This is to say that because scientists at the turn of the twentieth century believed race to be a natural phenomenon, they looked for racial determinants of the phenomena they studied. In the case of tuberculosis, Black patients were assumed to be sick at higher rates than white patients because of a supposed racial inferiority, and not because the systems of health actively harmed Black <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research.

My interest is in the covert ways ideas are made through the production of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Power refers to the ways discourses produce accepted understandings about the world, which reify the ideological groundings of accepted practices and understandings of a given culture."><b>specimens</b></span>.

A technology like film or radio mediates a message within its own technologically specific representational affordances, and mediation refers to the ways that technology enables a representational encounter.

How it is taken, how it is framed, and how the scientist describes the phenomenon on display are the result of a scientist making decisions: deciding to document a patient’s symptoms, deciding to autopsy the patient’s body, deciding to cut an organ from that body, deciding to place that organ into spirit, and deciding how to describe it in their collection.[^fn7]

In addition to TallBear’s read of Hall’s work on coproduction, I am equally indebted to the Jamaican-British scholar’s essay “Encoding/Decoding.” In the essay, Hall describes how television works in such a way as to give agency to both the producers of information and those that receive it. There is a kind of force in the ways dominant meanings are understood, which are entangled with a kind of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discursive</b></span> training. Hall writes, 

>since these mappings are ‘structured in dominance’ but not closed, the communicative process consists not in the unproblematic assignment of every visual term to its given position within a set of prearranged codes, but of *performative rules*---rules of competence and use, of logics-in-use---which seek actively to *enforce* or *pre-fer* one semantic domain over another and rule items into and out of their appropriate meaning-sets.[^fn8]

Hall’s “performative rules” assume that audiences are taught specific technical or genre conventions regarding the meaning of the art object. In the essay, he is referring to television conventions, diffusing the one-way transmission of information in moving image production. What is useful for me, and for this dissertation, is that this framework can also be used to understand scientific argumentation. Medical doctors have long been trained in various visual techniques---{#cI-27}clinical vision</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_1}}">1.2.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2}}">2.2.2</a>), microscopy(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3}}">2.1.3</a>)---and these forms of argument take time, expertise, and professional standardization to become taken for granted within a discipline. In order to see *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* through a microscope, a doctor first needed to know how to operate that tool, to accept what they see, and to agree with the method of isolating that material (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_1}}">2.2.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2}}">2.2.2</a>) (fig. 1).[^fn9] Scientific observers are primed to read a specimen in a specific way, and the producers of those <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research.

The production of specimens is entwined with an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span> assumption: that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research. An object is a non-human thing that a researcher can define or characterize within a disciplinary field or discourse."><b>knowledge objects</b></span> can be freely taken for the purpose of scientific argument. A recurring theme in this dissertation is the way medical practitioners map their own beliefs onto the bodies of the sick, and that this mapping creates a terrain from which knowledge may be extracted from those same patients. I use a cartographic metaphor to point toward a colonial spatial <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

Johanna Drucker, in an essay on digital humanities critiques of the data sciences, writes, 

>Data pass themselves off as mere descriptions of *a priori* conditions. Rendering observation (the act of creating a statistical, empirical, or subjective account or image) as if it were the same as the phenomena observed collapses the critical distance between the phenomenal world and its interpretation, undoing the basis of interpretation on which humanistic knowledge production is based.[^fn11]

To respond to this falsely ahistorical and apolitical frame of data, Drucker redefines the quantitative material drawn from natural sources as ‘capta’. Operating as a binary opposite of data, 

*>Capta* is ‘taken’ actively while data is assumed to be a ‘given’ able to be recorded and observed. From this distinction, a world of differences arises. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural representation of pre-existing fact.[^fn12]

This dissertation articulates the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> as *capta*. The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research. An object is a non-human thing that a researcher can define or characterize within a disciplinary field or discourse."><b>research objects</b></span>that I use in this dissertation are stolen, staged, and deemed natural (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4}}">0.1.4</a>). There is more than a representational construction of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>, but also a naturalization of these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term research object to refer to a  relationship between a researcher and what they research. An object is a non-human thing that a researcher can define or characterize within a disciplinary field or discourse."><b>research objects</b></span> which severs them from the original patient’s histories, cultures, and identities.[^fn13] The specimen is always taken. It is always taken from someone.

In attending to these thefts, there becomes a need to address the various technologies of capture, preservation, and dissemination. The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> as a media object is an intentionally broad category, attending to the various ways medical researchers ingest materials into their arguments. Media studies, and specifically film studies, has tended to rely on medicine’s use of cinematographic technologies. This means that disciplines like physiology have been examined in great detail,[^fn14] but others remain in need of continued scrutiny.[^fn15] The problem with these medium-first approaches is that they necessarily have to narrow the focus of the research: looking only for research that relied on filmic technologies.

By focusing on the specimen, I turn to look at the ways natural phenomena are made legible in scientific <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

[^fn15]: A good example of how this limitation causes problems for media studies scholars, is in Hannah Landecker’s otherwise exceptional work on microcinematography. She overdetermines the moving image’s transformative qualities in microscopic imaging, writing, “[t]he cellular film, an infinitely reproducible inscription of a continuous living movement rather than a set of histological stills, was a new form of narrative as well as a new set of aesthetic forms for both scientist and layman.”⁠ The problem is that while microcinematography was, indeed, novel, so was histology and histochemistry (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3}}">2.1.3</a>)
