In this chapter, I outline the development of the Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP) and discuss why this project became a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Born-digital projects are those whose primary output is in a digital form. A web page is born digital, whereas a book published in print and then released with an accompanying digital version is not."><b>born digital</b></span> dissertation. Through this analysis, I will touch on postcolonial (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_3">4.1.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3">4.2.3</a>), <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Anti-custodial practices are those that shift the ownership, stewardship, and access of archival materials away from knowledge institutions.

I discuss how this is informed by a careful approach to both <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> (4.2.5) and transparency (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_2">4.2.2</a>). I will also outline how these theoretical concerns were built directly into the code and workflow of the project (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_3_1">4.3.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_3_4">4.3.4</a>). This chapter will reflect on how this <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Practice-based research refers to methodologies that entwine various non-lingual, non-theoretical approaches to answer research questions.

While there will be code discussed in this chapter, I am choosing to omit a large percentage of the code developed by Kalani Craig in favor of a more theoretically grounded critique. The more technical aspects of this project can be found in the appendix (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_2_1">X.2.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_2_2">X.2.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_2_3">X.2.3</a>).

This dissertation did not start as a digital project. I am relatively new to digital humanities (DH) frameworks, tools, and perspectives, having only really embraced the methods in earnest at the peak of the pandemic in fall 2020. Imagining this project as a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Born-digital projects are those whose primary output is in a digital form.

What drew me to a digital dissertation was the ability to respond the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

I value non-traditional modes of presentation and engagement, as best evidenced through my creative work (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_1">3.2.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_4">3.2.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_1">3.3.1</a>), and the digital dissertation became another medium and platform to respond to the same problems that arose when working on *Tuberculous Imaginaries* (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_4">3.2.4</a>) and “Dermographic Opacities” (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_1">3.3.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_3">3.3.3</a>).

As outlined in the introduction to this dissertation (0.2.3), I borrow my understanding of the postcolonial and anticolonial[^fn1] from Afro-Carribean and Indigenous scholars. These knowledge workers have addressed and critiqued western knowledge practices that have been instrumental in the harm done to their communities.[^fn2] Especially in the case of Indigenous scholars, they respond to disciplines that stole information from their communities in addition to material objects, including the remains of their friends, families, and ancestors.[^fn3] When I use the term ‘colonialist knowledge system’ I am stressing the ways in which land, culture, and human bodies are seen as resources for knowledge claims (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4">0.1.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>).[^fn4]

These digital approaches also let me engage in a broader community of like-minded DHers, who see the field as a space to practice liberatory anticolonial work (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_2">4.1.2</a>). The OOPP is indebted to open publishing and collaborative initiatives within DH. This project built on top of a community archiving platform first developed by Indiana University’s Institute for Digital Arts and Humanities (IDAH)[^fn5] as part of its [Memory-making and Anti-custodial Reclamation for Collaborative Histories (MARCH) ](https://idah.indiana.edu/project-support/march/index.html) initiative.[^fn6] The community archiving project extended IDAH’s longstanding interest in minimal computing (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_2">4.1.2</a>),[^fn7] the use of digital tools to give communities agency over their artifacts and histories,[^fn8] and an interest in supporting underrepresented groups in ways that meant they did not have to relinquish their cultural artifacts to a university, archive, or library. That project started with a partnership with Marisa Hicks-Alcaraz---a media scholar whose video archival practices foreground the consent of the subjects who produce materials[^fn9]---and as of this writing, the team at IDAH has worked to archive materials at two community centers at Indiana University---La Casa, and the Asian Cultural Center.[^fn10]

The community archiving platform was developed specifically for use in these kinds of archival projects, but it has also been used in other contexts---for exhibitions and classrooms.[^fn11] Hicks-Alcaraz’s work is especially indebted to the anti-custodial turn in the archival discipline, which pushes beyond the critique of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

[^fn1]: I am especially drawn to the anticolonial turn, best described in Max Liboiron’s work. I will usually use the term anticolonial in this chapter because it reflects a process of both refuting the colonial and working to undermine and dismantle colonial systems. Anticolonial, for me at least, responds to the need for practices that undo colonial regimes, rather than critiquing colonial <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.
