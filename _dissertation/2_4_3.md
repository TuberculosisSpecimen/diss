In making this claim I intentionally omit the articulation of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> within knowledge domains.

Saidiya Hartman and Jessica Marie Johnson discuss this problem in terms of the archival record: the only materials that were saved were the ledgers which encoded Black bodies within the carceral violence of chattel slavery.[^fn1] Hartman and Johnson's work shows how can one do history when that history depends on a record that is itself an object of violence.

The Henry Phipps Institute in its early years almost exclusively served European patients. While it was only a few blocks away from Philadelphia’s ninth ward, a prominently Black neighborhood which W. E. B. DuBois wrote about in his monograph *The Philadelphia Negro,*[^fn2] almost no Black patients went to the Institute for their care. While the Phipps Institute tried to care for Black individuals with tuberculosis, these communities largely avoided the hospital. As Lawrence F. Flick writes in the Instutite’s second annual report, 

>The ratio of black to white has decreased during the current year. This is strange, and brings to light a social problem worthy of earnest consideration. Every inducement is offered to negroes to avail themselves of the treatment at the Phipps Institute, and there is absolutely no distinction made between the blacks and the whites. In spite of this, however, the blacks do not avail themselves of the opportunity for treatment. Tuberculosis is exceedingly prevalent among colored people, and the mortality among them is very high. They are careless in their habits, not over cleanly, and are therefore a menace to a community unless they can be brought under control and supervision.[^fn3]

It was only after a decade of operation that the hospital decided to hire their first Black doctor, which improved the connection between the Institute and their Black neighbors.[^fn4]

In this moment, Black patients performed a form of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span>---the conscious rejection of inclusion within western research (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_3">4.1.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3">4.2.3</a>).[^fn5] The success of that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> is marked by their absence in the Phipps Institute’s reports, and thus their absence in the hospital’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>pathological</b></span> collections.

Simpson writes, 

>contemporary fieldwork with Iroquois peoples involves being pushed and pushing back, a kind of discursive wrestling. There are *multiple* sovereignties at work, all of which have worked to protect, to limit, to entrench what was already in place, an exercise of political will that generated an exception, in Agemben’s theorization, to the liability of the subject.[^fn7]

I point to this fraught model because the extractive problem assumes not sovereign authority but an ethical authority over the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

I can make the claim that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span> are <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

Returning to Simpson, she articulates <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> on two ends: the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

>Rather, it is my proposition that to think about “sovereignty”---a construct which is always a bestowal and as such is deeply imperfect but critical for these moments in Indigenous/Settler-State relations---is to think very seriously about needs, and, basically, involves a calculus ethnography of what you need to know and what I refuse to write in.[^fn8]

Western relational methods, which often implicitly or explicitly depend on Indigenous, non-white, or otherwise subaltern philosophical principles, evacuate the researcher from their <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.
