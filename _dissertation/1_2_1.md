Edward Livingston Trudeau first moved to upstate New York in 1873. Trained as a doctor in New York City, he had worked at The Strangers' Hospital before becoming sick with tuberculosis. Frail and feverish, Trudeau left his family in the city to rest and recover in the Adirondacks. Writing in his autobiography, he explained his decision:

>I was influenced in my choice of the Adirondacks only by my love for the great forest and the wild life, and not at all because I thought the climate would be beneficial in any way, for the Adirondacks were then visited only by hunters and fishermen and it was looked upon as a rough, inaccessible region and considered a most inclement and trying climate. I had been to Paul Smith's in the summer on two occasions before on short visits with my friend Lou Livingston and his mother, and had been greatly attracted by the beautiful lakes, the great forest, the hunting and fishing, and the novelty of the free and wild life there. If I had but a short time to live, I yearned for surroundings that appealed to me, and it seemed to meet a longing I had for rest and the peace of the great wilderness.[^fn1]

Accompanied by his friend Lou Livingston, Trudeau sought refuge at Paul Smith's home in the Adirondacks, beginning a regimen of rest which resulted in a complete recovery over the course of a number of years. 

Upon getting better, the doctor began entertaining an idea of building a sanitarium in the same place he had recovered, having come across a summary of Herman Bremer's Sanitarium in a medical journal. He writes, "Brehmer was the originator of the sanatorium[^fn2] method, the essence of which was rest, fresh air and a daily regulation by the physician of the patient's life and habits."[^fn3] The {c1-16}rest cure</b></span>, which was commonly practiced in the Americas, originates from this practice ([1.2.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_3.html)), and the usage of the term sanitarium is also indebted to a translation of the German word *heilanstalt*, or 'healing place'*.* The word is linked to this term through the use of the Latin words *sanare*---to heal---and *sanitas*---healthy.[^fn4] While modeled on Brehmer's approach, the idea of an institution specifically suited for consumptive patients had been practiced in England. In 1836 George Bodington opened the doors of his consumptive sanitarium and asylum in Birmingham.[^fn5] These institutions, built on assumptions about the curative qualities of climate ([1.3.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_2.html)), or the medicinal qualities of specific waters or springs, existed long before the sanitarium craze, and still exist today.

Built from this lineage, the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium was a non-profit, charging less for patients who could not afford care. Trudeau first secured funding from generous contributions of past patients and their families.[^fn6] Opening in 1885, the institution slowly grew both in terms of how many patients it could hold, but also in its research facilities, becoming the most culturally and scientific important sanitarium in this period. This impact can be seen in the corpus, as its buildings are seen throughout the many publications. (figs. 1 -3; also many of the images in this section).

In the years following the opening of Trudeau's sanitarium, hundreds of similar institutions opened their doors for patients, and this first case study looks to examine the visual materials produced by and for these newly built institutions at the turn of the twentieth century. The rise of the sanitarium, as it was represented in the popular and scientific discourses around tuberculosis, represents a surprising visual focus away from the disease itself, and toward the spaces and environments of healing. I am drawn to these images because these photographs and illustrations seem to go against the overarching conceit regarding medical vision as explained by Michel Foucault ([1.1.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_1_2.html); 2.1.2). These images operate on a different visual field, and point to parallel developments in medical <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemics</b></span> and health culture. Their outsized presence in the corpus with more than 25% of the images representing an architectural space, demands attention (table 1).

Why were buildings, especially the creation of sanitaria, so important to the discourses around tuberculosis? Why do they take up so much of the space in the corpus' publications? The sanitarium constructed an ideal for health, which was entwined with the development of property ([1.2.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_4.html); [1.2.5](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_5.html)), as well as hygienic norms (1.3.0). Sometimes these institutions were found in advertisements-as-articles in the pages of medical journals ([1.2.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_3.html)) and other times they were located in directories for tuberculous patients ([1.2.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_3.html)). These images correspond to an emerging relation between patient and health care system, one bound to the idyllic, clean, technologically advanced, and stately health resort. What I am looking to is both the construction of an image around the sanitarium---as a health spa, a Romantic getaway, a space of healing---and also how healing is associated with the space of care, rather than any curative practice. What I will show is that there is a link with sanitaria, the growing and professionalizing American medical discipline (0.x.x), and an overt expansionism in medicine associated with the creation of medical facilities.

[^fn2]: There are different spellings of sanitarium. I use the spelling "sanitarium" in cases where the institution used that version. In this case, Trudeau uses both spellings in the course of a single paragraph.
