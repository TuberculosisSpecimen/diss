Apart from the features that stress legibility to a variety of audiences (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_2}}">4.2.2</a>), the Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP) was designed with a single key feature---an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> toggle, which gives users the ability to black out specific images and text based on an ethical framework of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_3}}">4.1.3</a>). I will discuss the code and approach to making this feature possible later in this chapter (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_3_2}}">4.3.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_3_3}}">4.3.3</a>; 4.4.4). For this section, I want to outline how the OOPP engages with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> through the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> functionality. 

As I discussed earlier in this chapter (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_3}}">4.1.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_4}}">4.1.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_1}}">4.2.1</a>), this platform engages in a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The term speculative refers to a broader discussion in history in how to best address structural violence which produces gaps in the archive.

I use ‘<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span>’ here as a key term in understanding how the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> toggle is formulated, because it links with a conversation in Indigenous theory regarding the exclusion of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research.

Max Liboiron and the CLEAR lab’s guidelines for community peer review describes this idea:

>The term *refusal* in a research context refers to ethical and methodological considerations about how and whether findings should be shared with and within academia at all, as researchers often encounter information that might be intensely personal, fundamentally contextual, sacred, intended only for certain people, or needs to be earned. Offering refusal is part of ensuring research is accountable to its relations. In refusal . . . fish harvesters and villagers set the terms of how and whether research that impacts their communities should occur, be conducted, and circulate. Practicing refusal keeps community knowledge from being a Resource.[^fn1]

Liboiron and their colleagues frame western research practices as prescribed by a colonial land relation---an assumption that land can be owned, maintained, and exploited by human actors, and which maintain these relationships through violent, often genocidal, means.[^fn2] This relation foregrounds an understanding that western <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

An object is a non-human thing that a researcher can define or characterize within a disciplinary field or discourse."><b>research object</b></span> as a kind of land---something that may be owned, demarcated, defined, understood, stolen, and sold---which is the ultimate decider in its value (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4}}">0.1.4</a>). As Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang articulate, “[t]o refuse settler sovereignty is to refuse the settler’s unquestioned right to know and to resist the agenda to expand the knowledge territory of the settler-colonial nation.”[^fn3]

In the case of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

This potential value, which is nested in the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>, usurps the rights of the historical <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research.

>When I’ve presented the methodology of community peer review to mostly white settler audiences, especially those that work with Indigenous groups, people are discursively on board, but questions tend to stray toward techniques of ensuring research is not refuted. That’s creepy . . . . Giving up the entitlement and perceived right to data is central---the central!---ethic of anticolonial sciences. You will lose things in anticolonial research that you automatically get as a researcher in colonial modes of research (regardless of your heritage).[^fn5]

For Liboiron the priority for anticolonial research is on the communities whom that research effects, not on the potential for knowledge that may be inferred from the extracted data, specimens, and arguments. Refusal prioritizes the rights of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research.

Important in my framing is the ways NAGPRA facilitates further extractive relationships between Indigenous communities, as well as the right to refuse the repatriation of artifacts which is afforded to institutions (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_4}}">4.1.4</a>).
