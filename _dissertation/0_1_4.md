>Objectivity preserves the artifact or variation that would have been erased in the name of truth; it scruples to filter out the noise that undermines certainty. To be objective is to aspire to knowledge that bares no trace of the knower---knowledge unmarked by prejudice or skill, fantasy or judgement, wishing or striving. Objectivity is blind sight, seeing without interference, interpretation or intelligence.[^fn8]

I use value, here, as a shorthand to describe how they produce economic, cultural, and professional benefits for those who take specimens from human subjects. This thinking comes directly out of how Ruth Richardson describes the human corpse as a commodity. Emerging alongside the mid-eighteenth century adoption of the Parisian method of anatomy---one which required all doctors to individually dissect a corpse to learn anatomy---a human cadaver became a valuable asset for medical education. Before their use in anatomy classrooms, human remains were considered to have no value, nor could they be owned; the adoption of the Parisian method in England and Scotland brought with it a shadow market for remains made possible by the work of restrictionists---body snatchers. As Richardson writes, “[n]o longer an object worthy of respect the body of [those stolen from their graves] became a token of exchange, subject to commercial dealing, and then to the final objectification of the dissection room.”[^fn9] The legal apparatus that addressed the widespread practices of body snatchers never questioned the pedagogical/<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

The specimen has multiple valences of value, because in this relationship between <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemics</b></span>, pedagogy, and commodity, there is also a direct link between the production of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span> and the ranking of medical schools. As J. M. M. Alberti argues, in the early nineteenth century in England and Scotland medical schools used their collections---often famous collections like John Hunter’s materials at the Royal College of Surgeons---to prove the value of the education they offered.[^fn10] What many scholars have argued, too, is that these supposedly valuable materials were often mined from communities who were deemed other or lesser in the broader culture. In the United States, Indigenous bodies and Black bodies were regularly stolen from their gravesites, with the Smithsonian being one of the main benefactors of these practices.[^fn11] The scale of posthumous theft practiced by medical researchers and anthropologists led to the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990, and following a number of scandals regarding the theft and use of the remains of Black children, there are activists pushing for the passage of a similar act protecting and repatriating the remains of Black Americans.[^fn12]
