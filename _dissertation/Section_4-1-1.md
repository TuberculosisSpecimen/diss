In 2016 I reedited a short film (originally produced in 2014), I made as part of an MFA in film and television production at Loyola Marymount. This film was, ostensibly, about the history of the atomic bomb, its aftermath, and my wide eyed horror, as well as my guilt, about the images the United States produced to study the aftermaths of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings (figs. 89 - 90). The film’s title, “The Modern Orpheus”, made reference to two texts: the secondary title to Mary Shelly’s *Frankenstein*, *Or the Modern Prometheus*, and to the Grecian Orpheus myth. Mary Shelly’s *Frankenstein* responded to the rise of the emirical sciences, and was written out of Shelly’s own experience watching graverobbers while visiting her mother’s grave.[^fn1] Orpheus is an oft remixed tale of love, loss, and the failure in trust, as Orpheus’ undoing is his gaze: he looks back to see if Eurydice is following him out of the underworld.

Figure 90. A still from *The Modern Orpheus*. This image is one of many images in the collected video for the project. A patient is shown with obvious wounds from the bomb, and filmed for some spurious scientific purpose, but more looks like they are reflecting on their own pain.

The mix of these two threads, I hoped, expressed a desire to see, and in seeing, remember as a valuable act. One of the films two narrators, a female speaker, makes this theme legible: she asks, “Do you remember Orpheus? By staring back, he trapped his love Eurydice in the underworld. He could not conquer death, but he could speak it, and by uttering that truth, he made it real.”[^fn2] In production, I had visited the National Archives in Park Slope in the Summer of 2013, to see what footage they had in the aftermath of the bomb. When I started wading through the troves of material, I found myself caught in a roiling current of guilt, rage, and American imperialism. Reflecting on this, in some promotional materials, I wrote,  “While I collected images, I found myself appalled by what I had unearthed. These images of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were so coldly collected. How could any ethical filmmaker agree to shoot images like these? How could anyone approach this work with such nonchalance?”[^fn3]

Unlike the preceding chapters, this chapter is not about tuberculosis. It addresses my artistic practice and how it informs my research (4.1.x). I am stepping back a few steps, self-mythologizing my previous work, to piece together a larger series of themes and problems that predate this project: health, science, individual guilt, and a history of violence hover over the images  and they are called out by the other narator, a male speaker: 

There is an argument to these images. The purest oppression is annihilation, and these documents express a biased scientific record: a sterilized, distorted vision through a victor’s lens. 

An American captured these images.

I know this language. The camera eye dissects the survivors. The individual is obliterated.[^fn4] 

In the film, I tried to reconceptualize this violent image, to make it known, to make it hurt a viewer in such a way to move an audience to reconsidering the past. I also felt successively more uncomfortable with the image itself. I sought to shift it, in the way Chris Marker evoked André Tarkovsky’s “the zone” in his 1984 film *Sans Soleil*. Playing with layering high contrast filters, I wondered if I could flatten the image, to undo the clinical vision of American doctors (figs. 92 - 93).[^fn5]

This chapter will reflect on a series of art works I produced between 2021 and 2023.[^fn6] These works specifically deal with the health sciences as I developed methods for humanist-facing, arts-based research (4.1.3; 4.6.0). I will spend time with these objects to reflect on the successes and failures of each. The concerns about the sick patient, their subjugation under a series of overlapping gazes, and an ethical imperative to reframe and remake these images stretches over close to decade of creative work. I will focus on four projects---*Terminal Imaginaries* (4.2.1), “Dermographic Opacities” (4.3.0),  *Tuberculous Imaginaries* (4.4.0), and *Tuberscopia* (4.5.0)---these successive installations show recurring approaches to the medical image. I will use my own writing, as it appeared in grants, blog posts, and the public facing websites for each of these projects to help frame what I was thinking when developing these projects, and I will address gaps and concerns I see with that line of thinking. Rather than be an exercise in ego boosting, I wish to use these case studies to consider how arts-based research can forward other forms of scholarship, to articulate how these projects have informed my own thinking, with the hope that future arts-based researchers can consider the recursive mixed method approaches arts-based research fosters.

I do arts-based research because it is a different mode of understanding, that fosters iterative, imperfect conclusions. It is messy and subjective, but its looseness, its attention to feeling, and its ability to examine aesthetic formations, enables insights which may be further leveraged in more traditionally academic discourses. This arts-based research does not supplant or supercede other knowledge practices, but is a step in a mutually beneficial process for traditional academics and artists alike. This dissertation would not exist in the same form without these projects, or the loose, imperfect methods that emerged through arts-based inspection.

The projects which I describe in detail in the following sections all explore the opaque as a critical methodology for the history of medicine. Opacity, as defined by Eduard Glissant, operates as a personal refusal to be ingested into western epistemic systems. [ADD QUOTE PROBABLY] (0.5.5, 5.0.0). The artistic and scholarly trajectory is thinking about how adding or subtracting noise in ways that display can subversively address implicit functions in the supplied visual artifacts. Iterative, this work has been successful to different degrees. What I hope to convey, however, is not the epistemic superiority of arts-based research, so much as the affordances of this loose, aesthetically driven kind of \*praxis\*.

To frame the specific projects described later, I first will describe in better detail as to what I mean by arts-based research (4.1.2), and reflect on the arts traditions upon which I build (4.1.3).

[^fn5]: I would do this again for another short film *The Vivisected Earth.* I am choosing to not directly reference this work, because of its similarity to *Modern Orpheus*, and because its subject matter of the former film is much more personal.

[^fn6]: The gap between the 2016 film and these more contemporary projects is due to a personal and creative hollowing by virtue of an unpleasant time learning film production at Loyola Marymount University.
