The images of the sanitorium correspond with another graphic practice commonly shown in scientific and lay discussions around tuberculosis. Often doctors would display architectural drawings in their discussions of consumptive interventions and cures; they would use them to display the merits of a given sanitorium. The architectural drawings extended what the medical scientists and practitioners thought they knew about tuberculosis---that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The open air approach to treating tuberculosis focused on the constant flow of fresh air. It was often paired with the rest cure."><b>open air</b></span> would benefit the patients, that excess sun would help them recover---by building spaces that afforded the safe and controlled environment for patients to be treated in this manner (figs. 1 - 3). Doctors were giving their input to the design of spaces, to the construction of sanitoria ([1.2.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_4.html)), and their insights were shared across their knowledge network. The explosion of tuberculosis care within the sanitarium system was also an explosion of health institutions, many of which remain in some way shape or form today.  The establishment of sanitaria created a kind of cultural zeitgeist---tackled by Thomas Mann and Susan Sontag in their own approaches to tuberculous cultures[^fn1] ([1.1.1](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_1_1.html))---but they also built, quite literally, a material foothold in areas across the North American continent.

If the period of growth in American medicine is defined by epistemic and pedagogical refinement and centralization, and by the burgeoning pharmaceutical power which began in this same moment (0.x.x), it was also aided in the very literal capitalization of land and resources in this same period: *medicine is not just the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy, and this process alienates the patient, turning them into a collection of pathologies rather than a human person."><b>clinical gaze</b></span>, or the view of the a patient as a cluster of chemical reactions, but it is also a practice that builds its solutions, through clinics, laboratories, and hospitals*. The photographs of sanitaria, with their empty rooms, scant representation of patients, and their focus on the pristine climate show the value of this space. Value, here, is used in a double-meaning (0.x.x). First these spaces were places for a cure, outfitted for microbial study, for the use of x-rays, and sometimes with spaces for autopsies ([1.2.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_2.html)). Second, these buildings were also valuable insomuch as they were property---developed property. Understanding it in this manner also helps unpack some of the implicitly classed ways doctors in the period were seeing their patients: if the medical practitioners could produce a safe and healthy living environment, then so should everyone else (1.3.3; 1.3.4; 1.3.5).[^fn2]
