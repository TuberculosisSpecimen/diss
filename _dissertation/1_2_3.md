The sanitarium provided space and time for patients to recover, with the benefit of medical supervision. Trudeau's Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium was a model in the United States ([1.2.1](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_1.html)), but it was not a monolith, as doctors oversaw different treatment regimens, from the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The open air approach to treating tuberculosis focused on the constant flow of fresh air.

What unified many was the thought that patients could and should travel to a space away from where they lived to partake of a cure, and that this space was commonly engineered in such a way as to be beneficial. The discussion of sanataria, their architectural and therapeutic benefits, litter the tuberculosis corpus.	*The British Journal of Tuberculosis* had a pair of long running series which promoted health institutions in the United Kingdom and Europe. "Institutions for the Tuberculous" spotlighted various health resorts and facilities, providing information about more local hospitals. The first issue of the first volume described the facilities of the King Edward VII Sanatorium in Midhurst (figs. 1 & 2), the Brompton Hospital Sanatorium and Convalescent Home in Frimley (fig. 3), and the East Anglian Sanatorium in Suffolk (fig. 4).

For the facilities described "Institutions for the Tuberculous", time is spent describing the amenities. The King Edward VII Sanatorium is described as having 

>2 hydropathic-rooms, 2 writing-rooms, 100 patients' bedrooms (50 men and 50 women), with 6 nurses' kitchens, linen-rooms, etc. The patients' bedrooms measure 13 feet 6 inches by 11 feet 6 inches, and are 11 feet high. The large windows open out on a balcony 8 feet in width.[^fn1]

These more rote descriptions are matched with descriptions of the dining facilities---"The dining hall is a handsome room, lined with Doulton Carrera ware, the floor being of stone, which can be heated from beneath"[^fn2]---and description of the institution's research facilities---"The pathological block consists of a post-mortem-room and thee well-appointed rooms for pathological and research work. Researches [sic] which have a direct bearing upon the treatment of consumption will form an important feature of this department."[^fn3] In a journal that aims toward an academic, scientific audience, the emphasis on the space as a curative agent gets folded into a means of promotion.

The King Edward VII Sanatorium presented itself in such a way because it was unlike other institutions. As Vincent Y. Bowditch states in a puff piece on British sanatoria for *The Journal of Outdoor Life*, "the sanatorium is not a charitable institution in the strict sense of the word, it being the wish of King Edward that wealthy patients should be accommodated as well as other less well-to-do people."[^fn4] With rooms running as much as five guineas (or around $26) a week[^fn5] and costing as little as two pounds two shillings (or around $10.50) for a week of care,[^fn6] the sanatorium was hoping to serve middle to upper class patients.[^fn7] As treatment was costly, the luxurious framing helped sell the sanatorium to the journal's audience---doctors and medical practitioners---about how the environment might benefit their tuberculous patients. The entries for "Institutions for the Tuberculous" read as ways for the professional practitioners to learn about potential facilities to send their patients, with brief descriptions of the amenties which could be used to persuade a sick patient to go there.

It was also likely that patients who were sick with the disease, or families of those who were sick, would look to the quasi-advertisements of sanatoria published in medical journals, or in collected books of sanatoria like the *Hand Book of Help for Persons Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) Directory of Tuberculosis Hospitals Sanatoria and Clinics* published in 1915 by New York City's Department of Health or Lilian Brandt's 1904 book *A Directory of Institutions and Societies Dealing with Tuberculosis in the United States and Canada*.  Brandt, writing in the introduction to the latter monograph, says that the book was "designed, first, to serve as a guide to the physicians and friends of consumptives, whether poor or well-to-do, by furnishing accurate information in regard to existing institutions".[^fn8] Many of the images in the corpus come from these kinds of publications, which are not scientific but speak to an audience to whom practicing doctors were a main constituent.

Brandt's directory, like *The British Journal of Tuberculosis*, uses photographs to make its argument. There are images of buildings, nestled comfortably in the landscape (fig. 5), empty and sterile rooms for rest and socialization (figs. 6 & 7), and relatively few images that actually show patients (fig. 8). Curiously, sometimes it looks like patients who are in the frame are left as an afterthought in relation to displaying the luxurious space of the sanitorium (figs. 8 & 9).

The photographs from *The British Journal of Tuberculosis* and Brandt's directly show an emphasis on space: on showing the merits of a Romantic escape from the modern ([1.2.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_2.html)), and the stately, health improving architecture (figs. 20 - 22). Articles, books, and pamphlets often used architectural diagrams to show how doctors designed spaces that afforded a tuberculous cure; sometimes these spaces would afford more sunlight or airflow ([1.2.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_4.html)).

In my analysis, I have used language associated with consumption in this case study. Not referring to the tuberclous consumption, I instead meant to point to consumption as it is used in relation to commodities. These images are advertisements. These images sell the sanatorium. I have also used this language to imply a relationship between these images and another non-clinical practice occurring in this <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourse</b></span>: sanatoria were being *built*. These images do not just correspond to spaces of healing, but also the result of capital investment, be it by private enterprises or non-profit community organizations ([1.2.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_4.html)). These photographs document the buildings themselves, either in their newly built glory, or in the retrofitted spaces where some sanataria were developed.[^fn9]

If the period of growth in American medicine is defined by epistemic and pedagogical refinement and centralization, and by the burgeoning pharmaceutical power which began in this same moment (0.x.x), it was also aided in the very literal capitalization of land and resources in this same period: *medicine is not just the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy, and this process alienates the patient, turning them into a collection of pathologies rather than a human person."><b>clinical gaze</b></span>, or the view of the a patient as a cluster of chemical reactions, but it is also a practice that builds its solutions, through clinics, laboratories, and hospitals*. The photographs of sanitaria, with their empty rooms, scant representation of patients, and their focus on the pristine climate show the value of this space. Value, here, is used in a double-meaning (0.x.x). First these spaces were places for a cure, outfitted for microbial study, for the use of x-rays, and sometimes with spaces for autopsies. Second, these buildings were also valuable insomuch as they were property---developed property. Understanding it in this manner also helps unpack some of the implicitly classed ways doctors in the period were seeing their patients: if the medical practitioners could produce a safe and healthy living environment, then so should everyone else ([1.3.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_3.html); [1.3.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_4.html); [1.3.5](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_5.html)).[^fn10]

[^fn5]: Using the bureau of labor statistics inflation calculator (which goes back to 1913), this would equate to around $826/week for care. The number that Bowditch cites as the first proposed cost was eight guineas or, with inflation around $1,319/week for care.
