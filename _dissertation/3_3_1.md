Between the completion of <i>Terminal Imaginaries</i> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_1">3.2.1</a>) and its follow up installation, <i>Tuberculous Imaginaries</i> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_4">3.2.4</a>), I developed a photo essay for the digital humanities methods journal <i>Epoiesen.</i> I will not go into much detail as to the written content, because it is openly accessible online;[^fn1] instead, I want to address two aesthetic aspects of the project: 1) the modes of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> employed in the essay and 2) how the project took advantage of web-based publishing for its aesthetic and academic argument. I will finish this section with a description of how the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Iterative, here, refers to a process of learning in which completed projects are analyzed after their completion. This analysis allows for future projects to be more successful, and to address new, but related concepts."><b>iterative</b></span> and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term recursive to describes an iterative process of examination, experimentation, and reflection."><b>recursive</b></span> engagement with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method.

I have referenced the idea of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> earlier in this chapter, and I will describe the concept more fully in the next (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_4">4.1.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3">4.2.3</a>; 4.2.5), but it is difficult to describe “Dermographic Opacities” without touching on the concept. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>Opacity</b></span> comes from the postcolonial philosophy of Édouard Glissant, and it is an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Anti-essentialism refers to a philosophical position that refutes singular causes for phenomena.

In the essay’s conclusion, I wrote,

> I made a call for an ethic of opacity: to offer these subjects a way of being viewed that does not reduce them to a disciplinary object. In the essay I failed (intentionally) because the physiognomy of the subjects forwarded my own claims concerning the racial, classed character of medical research (see Washington, 2006; Owens, 2017). My method sought to amplify frictions I saw in the material, and thus relied on the exploitative image itself to establish my claims---I reified the significance of these horrible images at the same time it tried to reject them.[^fn3]

For this project, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> produced a result that could be analyzed. I applied <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> to a number of images which were primarily taken from sources consulted in the <i>Terminal Imaginaries</i> installation, looking specifically at the dermatological textbooks sampled for projector A (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_1">4.2.1</a>). The project revised these images with different modes of excision, cutting away the material in the image until only the disease remained (figs. 1 & 2).

The choice to cut away at the image, to frame through erasure, through an activation of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span> was decided by two criteria. The first moment of erasure was intended to frame the interventions by medical professionals. The hands that grab the head of a patient (fig. 1), or the mechanical apparatuses that hold a patient in place (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_2">1.4.2</a>). The second layer of erasure was applied to display clinical photography’s assumed desire: the actual embodied symptoms found on the bodies of the sitter. The photo essay's readers could flip through the images with the use of a little bit of simple CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) incorporated into the page’s HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). The next two sections (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_3_2">4.3.2</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_3_3">4.3.3</a>) will describe the process in each format, briefly.
