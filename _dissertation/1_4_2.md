Doctor’s hands are important for their work: they are used to hold patients in place, to percussively tap on their chest to hear for tuberculous infection in the lungs (fig. 2), they are used in surgery, in autopsy. The tuberculosis <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="A corpus refers to a collection of texts used for computational analysis."><b>corpus</b></span> has plenty examples of images showing doctors how to use their hands (figs. 1 & 2).

Doctors’ hands appear more often in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> photographs, than doctors do in the professionally framed photographs discussed in the previous section (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_1">1.4.1</a>). Doctors reach out to display a diagnostic procedure (fig. 1); their hands work with experimental instruments (fig. 3). In some photographs the doctor’s hands may be necessary to display the proper way to go about a complicated procedure (fig. 4 - 6). The thing that unifies these later images is that the doctors’ hands emerge in the context of a different kind of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

So far in this chapter, I have avoided images that depict <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span>.

For this dissertation, these doctors’ hands serve as a bridge: to link these other <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual cultures</b></span> to the visualities of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>, which will appear in the next chapter (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_4">2.1.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>). They reveal a kind of construction and specificity in framing---to hold a patient still, to bring the camera to the patient or the patient to the camera, to have another pair of hands operate the machine---as well as an intention, to grasp both in an intellectual sense but also in a domineering one.[^fn1]

What is important, and what I see when I see doctors holding their patients in this way, is a striking contrast: while these images share an inkling of intent as the ones discussed in the previous subsection (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_1">1.4.1</a>), their composition is decidedly different. Where doctors and their patients are gazed at a distance in examples of doctors at work, the point of view in these accidental hands in frame is always much closer to the humans with the shot sizes ranging from a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="This shot length refers to when a human is framed with their head and part of their chest in view."><b>medium-close</b></span> to a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

This is partly because of the image’s intended object: the photographer is trying to capture something smaller than a whole human body. The reduction in scope---from whole room to a part of the body---is matched by the amount of space that can be taken up by the doctor: it is a scale of hands, not of bodies.

There is power expressed in this imaging practice---who is imaged and who is left out of the frame; who controls the image and who is imaged.

In the next chapter, I am going to look at the human body as it has been pieced apart---through magnification, through the dissection of organs. All of these images were been taken from the bodies of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

The doctors’ hands will be absent, but their intention will not be. Sometimes doctors’ intervention will be more apparent, like the use of a pin that pulls a flap of flesh to reveal what is underneath (fig. 7), and sometimes this will be less obvious, as the doctors dye cells of patients (fig. 8) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>). These processes follow a different kind of vision, one which is trained in doctors, but which <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Rhyme, as I use it, refers to a conceptual similarity between otherwise disparate concepts."><b>rhymes[^fn5]</b></span> with and engages in concert with the kinds of visual practices described in this chapter. While not dependent, the two are entangled in such a way so as it would do harm to pull them apart fully.[^fn6]
