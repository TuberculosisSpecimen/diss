Doctor's hands are important for their work: they are used to hold patients in place, to percussively tap on their chest to hear for tuberculous infection in the lungs (fig. 2), they are used in surgery, in autopsy. The tuberculosis corpus has plenty examples of images showing doctors how to use their hands (figs. 1 & 2). ![][_TuberculosisATreatisebyAm_1909_349_combined]

**Figure 2.** While not associated with tuberculosis, this image is in a larger text on differential diagnosis. It offers a kind of anonymity to the patient; although, that may be part of a treatment regimen. Carmody, T. E.. *The Differential Diagnosis of Lesions of the Mouth Due to Carcinoma, Sarcoma, Syphilis and Tuberculosis*. 1909.

Doctors' hands appear more often than in these professionally framed photographs. Doctors reach out to display a diagnostic procedure (fig. 1); their hands work with experimental instruments (fig. 3). In some photographs the doctor's hands may be necessary to display the proper way to go about a complicated procedure (fig. 4 - 6). The thing that unifies these later images is that the doctors' hands emerge in the context of a different kind of biomedical visual practice: when there is a specific object that needs to be depicted on another human's body.

With his back to the camera and the patient also partially concealed, the image focuses on the procedure itself. Francine, A. P.. *Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Its Modern and Specialized Treatment*.

So far in this chapter, I have avoided images that depict <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a scientific framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span>. What I have shown is that the contexts and discourses around medical <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> is much messier and broader than our friend Michel Foucault could articulate. For this dissertation, these doctors' hands serve as a bridge: to link these other <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual cultures</b></span> to the visualities of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a scientific framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>, which will proliferate in the next chapter (2.0.0). They reveal a kind of construction and specificity in framing---to hold a patient still, to bring the camera to the patient or the patient to the camera, to have another pair of hands operate the machine---as well as an intention, to grasp both in an intellectual sense but also in a domineering one.[^fn1]

What is important, and what I see when I see doctors holding their patients in this way, is a striking contrast: while these images share an inkling of intent as the ones discussed in the previous subsection ([1.4.1](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_4_1.html)), their composition is decidedly different. Where doctors and their patients are gazed at a distance in examples of doctors at work, the point of view in these accidental hands in frame is always much closer to the humans with the shot sizes ranging from a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="This shot length refers to when a human is framed with their head and part of their chest in view."><b>medium-close</b></span> to a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="This shot length refers to when a human's face takes up the whole image. An extreme close up involves when some part of the body (like an eye) takes up the entire frame."><b>close-up</b></span>. This is partly because of the image's intended object: the photographer is trying to capture something smaller than the body. The reduction in scope---from whole room to a part of the body---is matched by the amount of space that can be taken up by the doctor: it is a scale of hands, not of bodies. And the hands in frame are not always the intended object of interest; they are an unintentional side effect of a discipling practice (2.1.2). They hold patients in place. They make the phenomena visible. They turn the patient, the body, the organ, the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject refers to a single human actor who has been made into a researchable object within a knowledge system."><b>subject</b></span>, the object, whatever the intended imaging target, docile.[^fn2] 

I will address these ideas in more detail in the next chapter (2.1.2). What I want to convey, as I conclude this one is that there is power expressed in this imaging practice---who is imaged and who is left out of the frame; who controls the image and who is imaged. Some spaces are deemed clean and others dirty, some bodies are allowed rest and care and others are placed within a disciplining framework, where they are always st fault (2.x.x).[^fn3] These contrasts remain ever present in the discourse, born on tide of supposed superiority: by who cures and who is cured, by who researches and who is researched, by who has scientific/social/cultural authority and who does not (2.1.4).[^fn4]

In the next chapter, I am going to look at the body which has been pieced apart---through magnification, through the dissection of organs, through the high contrast of the x-ray. All of these images were been taken from the bodies of test subjects for the purpose of scientific research. The doctors' hands will be absent, but their intention will not be. Sometimes doctors' intervention will be more apparent, like the use of a pin that pulls a flap of flesh to reveal what is underneath (fig. 7), and sometimes this will be less obvious, as the doctors dye cells of patients (fig. 8). These processes follow a different kind of vision, one which is trained in doctors, but which rhymes[^fn5] with and engages in concert with the kinds of visual practices described in this chapter. While not dependent, the two are entangled in such a way so as it would do harm to fully pull them apart.[^fn6]

**Figure 7.** Often wet specimens, when left in jars of spirit or formalin, will be held in place by glass pins or glass plates. This image is unique because for photographs of wet specimens, there are fewer overt tools that help reveal parts of the organ. Bushnell, George.
