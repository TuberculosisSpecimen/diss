This causal linkage between similar symptoms was supported by posthumous observation, whereby a patient was autopsied following their death to inspect organs for aberrant formations or differences from the “normal” conception of that organ.[^fn1] 

This clinical method is best exemplified in the work of René Theophile Hyacinthe Laënnec. The French doctor used these same methods to link the tubercle---a small hardened mass the size of millet that would form in the lungs of patients with tuberculosis---to phthisis, or consumption (fig. 1). Viewing patients at the Hôspital Neker and diagnosing them with consumption, Laënnec then autopsied the patient's body after their death, looking for aberrations in normal anatomy that might be linked to the symptoms the doctor observed. Finding these hardened masses in the lungs of his consumptive patients, and not in patients who had died of other conditions, the French doctor was able to convincingly argue the relationship between the tubercle and consumption.[^fn2]

This emphasis on disease through symptom-focused analysis and its relation to anatomy creates an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

To create disease, medicine first needed to imagine an idealized human <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

Important for this mode of vision is an implicit dehumanization of the sick patient: the doctor is not trained to see the patient, but the disease as it manifests in their body. The problem of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

More contemporary scholars have engaged with medical vision to describe how different technologies have expanded upon or complicated Foucault’s original concept. In media studies, scholars like Catherine Waldby and Jose van Djick have described how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy. This process alienates the patient, turning them into a collection of pathologies rather than a human person."><b>clinical vision</b></span> is linked to technologies of transparency, which reveal the insides of the opaque body. Responding to x-ray, MRI, and other penetrative visual technologies, van Djick notes the continual quest for transparency as an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideology</b></span> in medicine that idealizes perfect, penetrative vision as a mode to better diagnoses and disease treatments.[^fn4] This transparency also becomes an aesthetic within which more perfect anatomies can be made. Waldby, criticizing the Virtual Human Project from the 1990s, describes the construction of a supposedly perfect anatomical dataset, through digital scanning, photography, and the slow destruction and liquification of two human subjects, one male and one female.[^fn5] For these two scholars, technology extends and refines Foucault’s ocular practices: always creating more avenues to see difference and more perfect representations of supposedly "normal" human anatomy.

At the turn of the twentieth century, these modes of transparency were just developing. Wilhelm Röntgen had only started to demonstrate the use of radiation in viewing the human body; x-rays would become a key diagnostic practice for future tuberculosis workers, but this would take decades of experimentation before standards would be developed.[^fn6] Photography was still being experimented with as a potential practice for medical research and diagnosis. Erin O’Connor describes the use of photography to catalog and reproduce rare pathologies for the use of lay doctors at the turn of the twentieth century. The technology of the photograph extended <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy.

One limitation for these scholars is an overcommitment to Foucault’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

Scott Curtis, who has researched medical film in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century, provides two useful frameworks to extend and complicate medicine’s visualities. First, the visual training employed in medical education was not just an alienating mode of seeing the patient, it was also <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Social construction refers to a philosophical approach to ontology and epistemics, where human understandings of phenomena are dependent on a social agreement regarding how that phenomenon is interpreted."><b>constructed</b></span> as a way to maintain <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

Doctors were trained to see the natural, as it was constructed for them through various media, from film, to photograph (fig. 2), to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid.

Curtis writes, “[t]he ‘objectivity’ of the scientific eye arose not merely out of professionalization but also in contrast to the ‘subjectivity’ of the untrained other. That is, disciplinary modes of viewing relied on <i>class</i> distinctions, as well as professional training.”[^fn10] The ability to read these images, obdurate and unyielding as they are, within the discourses already established, produced a means to distinguish medical doctors as experts and make clinical training valuable.

Second, in addition to this ocular professionalization, there are certain practices that co-opt and control technologies for <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

Curtis also argues that it is not just the doctor who is trained in particular ways, the patient and the measuring apparatuses must be trained as well.[^fn11] For photographic representations of disease, patients had to be held still (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_2">1.4.2</a>), and different technologies, like microphotography or <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Histochemistry is the study of chemical interactions on bacterial anatomy."><b>histochemistry</b></span>, had to be developed and evoked (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_1">2.1.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>).

These robust visual models provide helpful frameworks to think about medical vision; however, these modes of seeing, training, and making visible, depend on a top-down framework. They ask, what did the doctors want to see? How did they want to see it? And how did they make their visions possible? These are certainly questions I am trying to answer, but I want to add a secondary layer of analysis: How did these representational methods and frameworks produce value for researchers in their fields? How did these representations get made from the bodies of patients (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_4">2.2.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_3_1">2.3.1</a>)? How did the patient’s lived experience, and embodied history, become central in the articulation of biomedical claims (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_3">2.2.3</a>)? Importantly, the patient is a crucial interlocutor in this analysis, as all of these questions have to be asked using their bodies, their histories, and their remains (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_4">2.1.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_3">2.2.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_4">2.2.4</a>).

An important limitation in Latour’s representational framework, and early STS assumptions of scientific argument, is that they tend to evacuate the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use 'natural' in the same way Bruno Latour does: it refers to phenomena that is explicitly non-human."><b>natural</b></span> to focus entirely on the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Social construction refers to a philosophical approach to ontology and epistemics, where human understandings of phenomena are dependent on a social agreement regarding how that phenomenon is interpreted."><b>constructedness</b></span> of scientific argument.

I use the term "index" to evoke the work Roland Barthes and his emotive reading of photography. His book, <i>Camera Lucida</i>, while being a meditation on photography, spends a lot of time reflecting on death. The back half of the deeply personal monograph looks to a photograph of Barthes’ recently deceased mother, a photograph that had been taken when she was young. For Barthes, and only Barthes, the photograph is important, because it depicts a figure of someone who is lost, and signals the grief that erupts in the process of mourning. Photographs, for the French philosopher, are inherently tragic, because they carry with them an inevitability. They imagine people in such a way as to also, necessarily, refer to their death.

Reflecting on an 1865 photograph of Lewis Payne, a would-be assassin, taken by Alexander Gardener right before Payne’s hanging, Bathes writes

>The photograph is handsome, as is the boy: that is the <i>studium</i>. But the <i>punctum</i> is: <i>he is going to die</i>. I read this at the same time: <i>This will be</i> and <i>this has been</i>; I observe with horror an anterior future of which death is at stake. . . . Whether or not the subject is already dead, every photograph is this catastrophe.[^fn19]

Barthes’ reading of photographs is an empathic one, driven by the impossibility of the image. He spends a great deal of time in the book wrestling with the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Hermeneutics refers to the study of meaning, how it is conveyed, understood, and disseminated."><b>hermeneutics</b></span> of the photograph, coming to a model of analysis: The <i>studium</i> refers to the everyday interest in what a photograph might show, and the way they may be studied, which contrasts with the prick or <i>punctum</i> which stirs an excitement, engagement, or eroticism of a few unique images.[^fn20] The academic engagement with this technology is at a loss when what is imaged becomes personal and Barthes is enveloped in grief.

Published a decade after <i>Camera Lucida</i> ,Susan Sontag’s <i>Regarding the Pain of Others</i> examined the genre of refugee photos to untangle a similar problem.

>To speak of reality becoming a spectacle is a breathtaking provincialism. It universalizes the viewing habits of a small, educated population living in the rich part of the world, where news has been converted into entertainment---that mature style of viewing which is a prime acquisition of ‘the modern,’ and a prerequisite for dismantling traditional forms of party-based politics that offer real disagreement and debate. It assumes that everyone is a spectator. It suggests, perversely, unseriously, that there is no real suffering in the world.[^fn21]

Sontag notes the privilege of viewing suffering, of seeing it while flipping through a newspaper or magazine, of nonchalantly consuming it.

[^fn2]: An interesting note here, is that Laënnec’s practices were not as visually dominated as Foucault would argue, as Laënnec was the projenitor of the stethoscope and the practice of asculculation as a method to diagnose tuberculosis.
	
	Laënnec’s introduced the use of auscultation in diagnosis, as well as the auditory tool of the stethoscope; however, for the sake of this argument, my interest is particularly drawn by his use of postmortem analysis to make medical observations.

[^fn3]: The ramifications of this practice are myriad, and still impact the lives of individuals who do not fit within contemporary assumptions concerning the ideal (white, male) human subject.

[^fn12]: The last of these concerns is what has kept me in media studies, as I have moved to a much more interdisciplinary framework. While media studies began in a trajectory of English turned film studies, its frameworks are much more mutable than only focusing on popular, industrial, image-based representational technologies.
	
	I lean toward media archaeology partly because it blows apart the hierarchy of media technologies making the bespoke and mundane technologies equally interesting for scholarly analysis.
