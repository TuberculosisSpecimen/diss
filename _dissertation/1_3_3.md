"The Morgue", described in the previous section ([1.3.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_2.html)), represented a view which saw the environments of patients as being directly connected to their health. In these hygienic images which omit human subjects, there are a few running themes. The first is the most obvious: the clutter, the mess, the squalid conditions. These speak to a kind of hygienic approach to tuberculosis that focused on cleanliness. Associated with these examinations of the dirty, is also an interest in the less visible aspects of a living environment: the airflow and the access to sunlight (figs. 1 & 2). Public health publications were pushing for spaces that had more access to fresh air (fig. 3).

Airflow was a central tenant for climatic approaches to tuberculosis. As the popular understanding of the disease, which preceded Robert Koch's microbial studies (2.2.0), and was central to the conception of the health resort ([1.2.1](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_1.html); [1.2.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_3.html)).  However, at the turn of the twentieth century, these assumptions were shifting because doctors were noticing that the air in very different locations---like Colorado Springs, the Adirondacks,  California, and North Carolina---was quite different, but the sanatoria in those locations seemed to be helping patients nonetheless. A simpler explanation was emerging: an escape from the city meant better health outcomes overall ([1.2.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_2.html)). As James Alex Lindsay argues in an 1887 monograph on the climatic treatment, "There is, in fact, no ideal climate for consumption; no happy Hygeia to which the consumptive can repair and draw in healing influences with every breath.[^fn1]" For Lindsay, the climatic treatment functions on a binaristic view of localities: he imagines the places where tuberculous patients live as crowded, dank, unhealthy places. Patients undergoing climatic treatment move from "comparatively sunless and depressing climates", from "crowded populations and vitiated air", from "the injurious influence of damp soil and of imperfect sanitation", to give "the patient the great boon of change---change of air, change of diet, change of scenery, change of daily routine, change involving the abandonment of many an injurious habit which has long been the secret minister of disease."[^fn2] Twenty years later, a summary of climatic approaches to care prepared by F. C. Smith for the United States Surgeon-General argued the same, writing: "in a man of fairly good personal and family history, the chances are that he may fight a winning battle if he lives out of doors in any climate, whether high, dry, and cold or low, moist and warm".[^fn3]

The popular imagination, built on an older practice of the health spa contrasts with the arguments made by prominent professionals. The concept of healing air, associated as it was with a regional disposition to help or hinder health, was narrowed and understood in the inverse. There were manufactured causes for certain kinds of harms, which could be addressed at a human scale,[^fn4] and which effected the public. Important, for this case study, is the remedy was placed on the responsibility of the patient: to seek help, to learn more hygienic modes of living, to move from poorly ventilated living situations.[^fn5]

In this context then, the emphasis on airflow and light highlights the poor environments for poor people living in urban centers. Conceivably they could recover, should they be treated with the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The rest cure was an approach to tuberculosis where patients were encouraged to do as little as possible and rest to recover their energy.

It was often paired with the rest cure."><b>open air</b></span>, even if that air was still within an urban space. There are many images of adhoc and improvised rest cure spaces, with patients sleeping on rooftops (figs. 4 & 5), on fire escapes (fig. 6), and with their windows left open at all times (fig. 7 & 8).

Just as with the sanitarium, the solutions to tuberculosis are built ([1.2.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_2.html); [1.2.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_4.html)). There is a call for a more architectural solution, which is levied against every dangerous building with poor light and ventilation. Unlike the previous case study, there is another approach that is layered on top of the construction of hygienic spaces: the poor are seen as being at least partially to blame for their illness. There is an implicit assumption that there is always something more for a tuberculous patient to do, which attention to cleanliness in living space ([1.3.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_2.html)), the intervention of public funds, and the education provided by a public health nurse could all make possible ([1.3.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_4.html)).
