<b>Figure 1.</b> A lung autopsied as part of research into tuberculosis. From Bushnell, George E. ”Manifest Pulmonary Tuberculosis," <i>The American Review of Tuberculosis</i> 2. (1918-1919), 171.

This example comes from an essay written by George E. Bushnell, which was penned to assist in diagnosis of tuberculosis, with specific interest for military service. Bushnell had been a prominent doctor during World War I, developing a robust protocol for diagnosing tuberculosis in enlisted troops. Bushnell had spent more than a decade running the hospital at Fort Bayard, in New Mexico, before he was tapped by the surgeon general to open the Office of Tuberculosis in the Division of Internal Medicine in 1917. The U.S. army had experienced difficulty in reliably determining whether its soldiers were sick with the disease, with misdiagnosis being a prominent concern, as they tried to enlist as many able-bodied men as possible. Bushnell spoke against tuberculin as a diagnostic method, and blustered against how often patients would be diagnosed with tuberculosis without a positive sputum test (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>).[^fn3]

Bushnell’s goal for this essay was to better describe incipient tuberculosis: 

>The text books, with their numerous subdivisions and wealth of detail, are confusing to the beginner, who is apt to feel at a loss when confronted by the varied signs of large tuberculous lesions. Yet the importance of skill in the diagnosis of age and kind of lesions present in a given case is great for all who have to do with tuberculous cases, for upon such diagnosis depends the prognosis. Prognosis is the first and last thing demanded of the physician by the patient's friends, and upon the prognosis which he gives he is judged.[^fn4] 

The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid. Contemporary wet specimens are usually submerged in a formalin mixture, and older specimens from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were usually preserved in a spirit like rum or whiskey."><b>wet specimens</b></span> provided in the essay give context to the phenomena occurring within the patient’s body. This plate was used to describe the progression of the disease within a patient’s lung:

><span class="opaque-lines">The tubercle invasion is checked in the bronchial tubes which run downward and outward and directly downward, but such checking tends to assemble the invaders, returning them to the hilus whence they can act as reinforcements else where. The bronchi which extend laterally through the lower lobe, since their lymph channels run nearly at right angles to the diaphragmatic suction, are particularly exposed.</span> It is common to see an extension along such a bronchus which shows itself at autopsy as a series of bronchopneumonic foci grouped about the tube ( Plate IV ). <span class="opaque-lines">Here we have what is really an atypical peribronchial extension.</span> During life our means of diagnosis do not permit the recognition of the fact which is, however, worthy of note as respects the prognosis. We may put the facts in this way. Extensions in the lower lobe are more apt to involve the entire course of the bronchus, from the hilus to the periphery, than extensions higher up in the lung. What we judge of as superficial extensions of perhaps slight extent are here really the outward manifestations of a very considerable process, the greater part of which runs its course in the deep lung.[^fn5]

The description Bushnell provides gives both explanation as to why the phenomenon occurred, and its association with the assumed <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> development. A military man, Bushnell articulates the site of the body as an invasion, which was a common theme in the discourses around the disease in the period,[^fn6] and his description of the organ and its <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathologies</b></span> narrates the disease’s aftermath. The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> provides a visual example of the progression Bushnell describes, and it is framed, edited, and prepped for his audience. 

In the preparation of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>, there are two kinds of framing at play: the first form of framing is a reduction in unnecessary material. While obvious, it is important to remember the labor and care that is made to take this organ out of its original context: we are not gazing into the patient’s chest cavity. All of the material that has been stripped away has been deemed unimportant for the sake of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> argument. The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use this term, 'material', to connect my thinking to new materialism, a philosophical posthuman approach which sees nonhuman agents in the world as having distinct agencies. Material broadly refers to the complex lives of nonhuman-- things and their interactions in the world."><b>material</b></span> is <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge. Disciplining is a process where certain phenomena are made understandable through demarcation and definition in an academic field."><b>disciplined</b></span> in such a manner so as to remove any unnecessary noise in the form of unwanted viscera, a kind of scientific and medical reductionism (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>).[^fn7] 

The second kind of framing is a contextual one: while the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> phenomenon is the target of attention, in isolation it has no meaning.[^fn8] The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin. Object, as I use it, carefully considers how human patients are denied their humanity through transformations that deem them as objects."><b>object</b></span> in context, whatever context the creator of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> deems valuable, is necessary for it to function: this context points to the phenomenon’s location in the lung, and it is in this context that a medical viewer can understand how that phenomenon might have affected the organ. It helps show the relationship of this phenomenon for future diagnostic or symptomatic conceptions of the disease. 

I use the term ‘<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge. Disciplining is a process where certain phenomena are made understandable through demarcation and definition in an academic field."><b>discipline</b></span>’ to refer to Michel Foucault’s later-career approach to knowledge work: that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Power refers to the ways discourses produce accepted understandings about the world, which reify the ideological groundings of accepted practices and understandings of a given culture."><b>power</b></span>---the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Knowledge/power articulates the ways disciplinary knowledge production is interlinked with modern governmental, juridical, and social ideas and practices. It assumes that the production of knowledge is bound to political ideologies, activities, and authority."><b>knowledge-defined</b></span> processes which produce meaning and its contexts through collective conversation---functions in such a way as to define certain phenomena in ways that contain that phenomena within a predetermined set of metrics. The prisoner, for Foucault, is doubly <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge. Disciplining is a process where certain phenomena are made understandable through demarcation and definition in an academic field."><b>disciplined</b></span> both in the structures which confine them within the prison, but also within the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Knowledge/power articulates the ways disciplinary knowledge production is interlinked with modern governmental, juridical, and social ideas and practices.

The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> works similarly: it produces the contexts and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discourses</b></span> within which the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> is valuable, and produces the aspects of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> which are most important. These processes are implicitly political: most obviously in the case of the modern prison system, and more subtly for the understanding of tuberculosis. The reduction of the body into a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>, the boring of vision down to the cell, assumes that with infinite specificity there will be a potential for control (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4">0.1.4</a>). Control is, of course, valuable insomuch as perfect knowledge may afford the development of pinpointed, hypertechnical, miraculous cures, but it also is an explicitly totalitarian logic.[^fn10] 

Like with the three-body problem---an astrophysical thought experiment which shows how it is impossible to produce a simple model to describe and predict the gravitational effect of three different celestial bodies upon one another---understanding a single phenomenon in isolation is at odds with the realities of deeply complex and interrelated natural world. Keeping the locus of knowledge at small, specific scales addresses complexity, while also affording the continuation of philosophical presumptions regarding the individual (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_3">2.2.3</a>). If the individual is a single entity, where the disease is neatly contained, and the organ---itself an object whose boundaries are set and defined---is the seat of the disease then it is easy to reduce down, to point blame to individuals (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_4">1.3.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_5">1.3.5</a>), and to place value in the discrete embodied space of the cadaver. The leaky,[^fn11] embedded, and entangled[^fn12] self muddies the essential origins and results of a given disease.

Returning to the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> imaged at the beginning of this section (fig. 1), it has been neatly disciplined to foreground these specific understandings of the disease. This lung depicts the progression of tuberculosis in its upper lobe. It represents these assumptions, in such a manner as designed by George E. Bushnel. The U.S. Army doctor viewed the disease as incipient, and thought almost all of the men he surveyed had been infected with the disease at a young age.[^fn13] His views were interlinked with racial conceptions of health: he penned a book on tropical medicine, <i>A study in the epidemiology of tuberculosis, with especial reference to tuberculosis of the tropics and of the negro race</i> in 1920, a few years before his death in 1924,[^fn14] which viewed the prevalence of the disease as a means of protection, tying the mass deaths of newly contacted Indigenous communities to the spread of tuberculosis (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_5">1.3.5</a>).[^fn15]

I chose this <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid. Contemporary wet specimens are usually submerged in a formalin mixture, and older specimens from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were usually preserved in a spirit like rum or whiskey."><b>wet specimen</b></span> prepared and reproduced by Bushnell because of the doctor’s tenure in the U. S. Army. The production of this representation is <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="From Derrida, circumcision thinks about how marking objects--through writing or ware--creates an embodied meaning on or inside the object."><b>circumcised</b></span> by the doctor’s actions (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_1">2.2.1</a>),[^fn16] but it is also tied to the history of the patient who died (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_3">2.2.3</a>), who has otherwise been erased in this argument. Bushnell’s centrality in the diagnosis and treatment of military men heading to the trenches asks a further question: where did he procure this lung? Most likely, it was taken at autopsy of a man who died under Bushnell’s care at the hospital at Fort Bayard or during his time in Washington, D.C.. Had this man <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the phrase 'consent' to refer to the idea of informed consent: that a research subject needs to be aware of what will happen to them in a research project, and that they have the ability to say 'no' at any point during the research program."><b>consented</b></span> to this autopsy?

What other portions of his body were disassembled?
