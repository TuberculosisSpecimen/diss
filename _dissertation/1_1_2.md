As Nicholas Mirzoeff defines this process, it is “an interaction of the visual sign, the technology that enables and sustains that sign, and the viewer.”[^fn1] So the meaning which is generated from a visual form is not an A to B transmission of idea from representational <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.

Ways of seeing have been tied to ways of knowing, and they help make sense of the various <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

As Jonathan Crary argues, “[v]ision and its effects are always inseparable from the possibilities of an observing subject who is both the historical product and the site of certain practices, techniques, institutions, and procedures of subjectification.”[^fn3] 

This framework, while deeply convincing, has a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Methodology refers to the approaches scholars take to answer research questions."><b>methodological</b></span> issue: it generally uses case studies to represent broader cultural attitudes regarding vision. Jonathan Crary used changing scientific understandings of vision to contextualize and understand impressionist and post-impressionist painting;[^fn4] Anne Friedberg discussed the breakdown of the single point perception of depth to understand how graphic user interfaces (GUI) became so commonplace in computing;[^fn5] and Michel Foucault uses the development of the anatomical-clinical method to understand the ways patients are objectified and othered in the process of medical diagnosis (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>).[^fn6] In many ways these arguments are compelling because of how they take a medium-range research program, focused on some cultural phenomenon as it interacts with all sorts of other cultural processes, and extrapolates it into a generalizable understanding, which can, in turn, be projected outward to other related phenomena.[^fn7] 

The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy.

It is a popular, compelling, and deeply helpful framework, because it provides a shorthand for different <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

For this chapter, however, it is important to know that, unlike Foucault’s later post-structural post-1968 scholarship, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy.

How would medicine’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> be understood if <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

One of the through-lines for this chapter is an interest in point of view: doctors were looking at their patients in a clinical mode, but they also followed other modes of aesthetic and visual practice.[^fn10] They built sanatoria and advised on the hospital wards (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_4">1.2.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_5">1.2.5</a>); they imaged patients, and at times were caught on the other side of the camera lens (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_1">1.4.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_2">1.4.2</a>). Importantly, they were not the only actors making visual material, as charity organizations also began springing up in this same period, sometimes run by medical professionals and sometimes not.

[^fn9]: A note here: I am mostly focusing on how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

My reasoning here is that *Birth of the Clinic* focuses on the anatomical-clinical method, which is more closely tied to the extraction of biomatter from posthumous patients.
