I am articulating my claims in relation to a discourse known as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span>. An <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term interdisciplinary (as opposed to multidisciplinary) in this dissertation to convey how different methodologies and frameworks guide my research."><b>interdisciplinary</b></span> field which was popularized in film studies and art history at the end of the last century, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> is interested in the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Social construction refers to a philosophical approach to ontology and epistemics, where human understandings of phenomena are dependent on a social agreement regarding how that phenomenon is interpreted."><b>socially constructed</b></span> ways by which cultures see. By understanding the socially, temporally, and regionally bound ways subjects are instructed to see, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> scholars work to understand how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideologies</b></span> are tied into representative objects and practices. This field sees the processes of looking, the "visual event", as an act which is the result of a co-constitutive process of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideology</b></span> history, place, and temporality. As Nicholas Mirzoeff defines this process, it is "an interaction of the visual sign, the technology that enables and sustains that sign, and the viewer."[^fn1] So the meaning which is generated from a visual form is not an A to B transmission of idea from object to subject, but instead the result of a constellation of influences ranging from the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

Ways of seeing have been tied to ways of knowing, and they help make sense of the various ideologies which are taken for granted in a given culture. The modern viewing subject was constructed by and through scientific experimentation. As Jonathan Crary argues, "[v]ision and its effects are always inseparable from the possibilities of an observing subject who is both the historical product and the site of certain practices, techniques, institutions, and procedures of subjectification."[^fn3] 

This framework, while deeply convincing, has a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Methodology refers to the approaches scholars take to answer research questions."><b>methodological</b></span> issue: it generally uses case studies to represent broader cultural attitudes regarding vision. Jonathan Crary used changing scientific understandings of vision to contextualize and understand impressionist and post-impressionist painting;[^fn4] Anne Friedberg discussed the breakdown of the single point perception of depth to understand how graphic user interfaces (GUI) became so commonplace in computing;[^fn5] and Michel Foucault uses the development of the anatomical-clinical method to understand the ways patients are objectified and othered in the process of medical diagnosis (2.1.2).[^fn6] In many ways these arguments are compelling because of how they take a medium-range research program, focused on some cultural phenomenon as it interacts with all sorts of other cultural processes, and extrapolates it into a generalizable understanding, which can, in turn, be projected outward to other related phenomena.[^fn7]

It is a popular, compelling, and deeply helpful framework, because it provides a shorthand for different <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods."><b>biomedical</b></span> practices, from microscopic vision, to medical cinematography, to clinical photographs, to technologies of transparency, to the utopian construction of a perfect anatomical subject.[^fn8] I will go into more detail as to the function and practices associated with <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

For this chapter, however, it is important to know that, unlike Foucault's later post-structural post-1968 scholarship, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy, and this process alienates the patient, turning them into a collection of pathologies rather than a human person."><b>clinical vision</b></span> was the result of a singular case study into a specific historical moment: Foucault was looking at medicine in post-revolutionary France, and his observations came out of that cultural, scientific, and political moment. 

How would medicine's <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> be understood if <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

One of the through-lines for this chapter is an interest in point of view: doctors were looking at their patients in a clinical mode, but they also followed other modes of aesthetic and visual practice.[^fn9] They built sanitaria and advised on the hospital wards ([1.2.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_4.html); [1.2.5](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_5.html)); they imaged patients, and at times were caught on the other side of the camera lens ([1.4.1](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_4_1.html); [1.4.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_4_2.html)). Importantly, they were not the only actors making visual material, as charity organizations also began springing up in this same period, sometimes run by medical professionals and sometimes not. Medicine's <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> is not a singular object, but a weave of contested <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.
