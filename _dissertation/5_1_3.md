I have two reasons for describing the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> in this manner. First, I want to speak to why something as obviously horrible as stolen human remains can be so staunchly defended by academics and their institutions.[^fn1] This dissertation is surrounded by questions of value---cultural value, monetary value, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span> value (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4">0.1.4</a>). The latter of these could be conceived in the context of its origination: how the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> was leveraged for a specific claim and then became historical as it was interlocked with a historical moment. But often these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin. Object, as I use it, carefully considers how human patients are denied their humanity through transformations that deem them as objects."><b>objects</b></span> have <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span> value that extends beyond their original use: they can be used to make different claims in a variety of fields (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/5_1_2">5.1.2</a>). They cannot be discarded because their potential value is infinite. If they were discarded, what would happen if a scholar develops a new method to extract information from them and is unable to glean it for their arguments? As long as knowledge work is viewed in a capitalistic, all-consuming conquest of the knowable, then every <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin. Object, as I use it, carefully considers how human patients are denied their humanity through transformations that deem them as objects."><b>research object</b></span> is undeniably worth clinging to.[^fn2]

The second reason I write about this is in direct opposition to the academic system within which I work. Universities are expected to grow their student populations, their research output, their grant income, their donations, their campuses.[^fn3] Much has been written about the blight that is the neoliberal university, but these critiques never seem to be critical of the knowledge systems themselves.[^fn4] We can blame Regan and Clinton and Bush junior and Bush senior and Obama and Trump and Biden for all of the awful systems, but we cannot seem to reflect upon how our <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge. I use it to talk about the entwined practices of scientific culture, its arguments, and its methodologies."><b>epistemic</b></span> assumptions are also built on <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideologies</b></span> of infinite growth. 

Why do universities need so many graduate students, when only the lucky few will get jobs in their fields? Why are scholars so susceptible to for profit publication farms? Why do journal citation metrics matter? Why do we shelter high publishing scholars who abuse their students? Why is it that we create aesthetic categories over what constitutes ‘good’ research? Why do we need more journals to publish more essays which no one has time to read?[^fn5] 

The western university is a knowledge factory[^fn6] and its raw materials are usually the materials taken from outside itself, from people unaffiliated with the university and people who will not benefit from the knowledge gained. The colonialist extractivism which I have delineated in this project is a result of the infinite appetite of the current, global knowledge system, a system indebted to the west’s colonialist roots.

[^fn5]: Moreover, for the excellent scholarship that is published, how can anyone be expected to find it, especially when prominent journals can be their own <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

[^fn6]: I borrow this phrase in part from Henry A. Giroux who talks about universities as degree factories.
