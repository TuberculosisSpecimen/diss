The following is the code used for the mouseover functionality.[^fn1]

To add mouseover, this is the code used, which is written directly into the markdown file:

    <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title=“[content]“><b>[defined-term]</b></span>

Here is an example of the code from the first chapter (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_4">1.3.4</a>):

    <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The open air approach to treating tuberculosis focused on the constant flow of fresh air. It was often paired with the rest cure."><b>open air</b></span>

<div class="style-divider">
 	<div class="line"></div>
</div>
