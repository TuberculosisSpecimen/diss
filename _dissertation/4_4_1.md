The Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP) was developed with the intent of providing a different kind of rhetorical method to the history of medicine (4.2.5). It is indebted to the critiques of Indigenous and postcolonial thinkers (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_3">4.1.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3">4.2.3</a>), and it <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term speculative refers to a broader discussion in history in how to best address structural violence which produces gaps in the archive. Speculative history imagines what might have happened, or otherwise fill in the gap where these violences occurred."><b>speculatively</b></span> reframes historical patients within contemporary understandings of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the phrase 'consent' to refer to the idea of informed consent: that a research subject needs to be aware of what will happen to them in a research project, and that they have the ability to say 'no' at any point during the research program."><b>consent</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_4">4.2.4</a>).

As I developed the OOPP and as I wrote the dissertation in earnest, I knew that, for the most part, the erasures that the OOPP enabled were not going to disrupt my argument too much. This is partially a result of my mid-scale analytical frame: looking wide enough at the scientific literature to point to specific things happening in the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discourse</b></span>, but not close enough to point to specific patients in the process. It is also a result of a broader understanding of the kind of labor which is done by researchers working in the past. We do a lot of summarizing, and we do a lot of precise framing: picking specific material and omitting swaths of others that best enable our arguments. I do not need images of patients to understand that doctors might have unethically tested on them, because the ways the doctors viewed their patients was evident in their writing. The specific examples help me emphasize a point, but they are not <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

I say this because what I am arguing against is less the digital materials with which I work,[^fn1] but to think of them as a stand-in for the materials which I did not have access: <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid. Contemporary wet specimens are usually submerged in a formalin mixture, and older specimens from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were usually preserved in a spirit like rum or whiskey."><b>wet tissue specimens</b></span> preserved in research institutes and museums (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4">0.1.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_4">4.2.4</a>). One of the implicit arguments that I make in this dissertation is the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Social construction refers to a philosophical approach to ontology and epistemics, where human understandings of phenomena are dependent on a social agreement regarding how that phenomenon is interpreted."><b>social construction</b></span> of value around research materials (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_4">0.1.4</a>). They do not have inherent value, so much as the value that scientists, historians, archivists, and institutions imbed in them; scholars reify that value even when they look at these materials in a critical light. This latter point is something I am constantly writing about, and which I mention whenever I present.

My challenge, using the OOPP and this dissertation as my main example, is that the divestment of human material from collections will not mean a reduction of potential historical research, but it does mean a reduction of potential value within the institutions which house them. One of the main problems of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) is that it gives the final say in the repatriation process to the same facilities who ascribe and maintain the value of those stolen <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin. Object, as I use it, carefully considers how human patients are denied their humanity through transformations that deem them as objects."><b>objects</b></span>.[^fn2] I want to make that value system obvious, and to reduce that same system through a practice of ethical elision---<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_3">4.1.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3">4.2.3</a>).

The OOPP is a way to share that practice and invite other scholars to develop their own interventions in many fields. While I cannot erase the extractive methods which historical patients were subjected to, and I cannot actively remove materials from any collection. I can provide tools to others who also wish to unsettle the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.
