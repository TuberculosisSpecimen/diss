The image of the sanatorium as it appears in this case study seems much more about the building of things, rather than the care of patients. Attention to the link between simplistic capital accumulation and the growth of the medical enterprise, provides a necessary expansion of a Foucauldian framework---a way of thinking that stresses the singular importance of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathologizing</b></span> practices in medicine (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_2">1.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>).[^fn1] Instead, a focus on property expansion and the building of facilities as a product of an intermingling of various <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

In this example, manifest destiny and the conquest and subjugation of Indigenous nations undergirded the establishment of many of these health enterprises, especially those in the American west.

This way of seeing, in the case of sanatorium photographs and architectural diagrams (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_3">1.2.3</a>), slips beyond the remit of this project, partly because of the limit of a medically focused sample.  However, just as Foucauldian vision limits clinical <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

While doctors saw through their patients as a manifestation of symptoms, they also saw their patients as classed, raced, sexed, and abled (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_5">1.3.5</a>). All of these ideas were entwined with and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathologized</b></span> under the logics of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Eugenics refers to a way of thinking that thinks that human society can bettered by selective reproduction.

The logic circumvents the more obvious economic and structural issues which, as a viewer from the twenty-first century, seem so obvious.

Value, as I use it in this dissertation, refers to a network of potential benefits for the actors who extract it from their resources---in this case, from the land they claim, develop, and work upon.

Total arguments, like hard metals, are unscratchable but easily shattered, and diffuse arguments are malleable, but prone to imperfections.

The sanatorium is many things, from idyllic resort, to charity organization, from space of cure to location of research; it is, in all of these contexts also a space that needed to be built, and that needed to have sufficient financial input by would be investors (public and private alike). In the century after the height of the sanatorium movement, these buildings have tended to be subsumed by American <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

[^fn1]: My suspicion, which would require an entirely different research project to examine, is that over the course of the life of a decades-long institution the cost of building a structure is quite low as compared to the cumulative annual operating costs, and that these buildings presumably hold their value as opposed to the supposed wastefulness of paying others for their time and effort. Capital projects concretize and centralize value as opposed to disperse it among the laborers who would spend it elsewhere.
