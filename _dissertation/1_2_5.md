The image of the sanatorium as it appears in this case study seems much more about the building of things, rather than the care of patients. The linkage of this kind of simplistic capital accumulation and the growth of the medical enterprise, through the emphasis on the creation of new structures should not be ignored.[^fn1] Importantly, this case study implies a helpful critique of Michel Foucault's frameworks, which is to stress that while doctors look at and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathologize</b></span> their patients, their gazes are also fixed on, and informed by, a number of broader cultural and political ventures. *The clinical gaze is particularly adept at critiquing the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

In this case study medicine is entwined in broader <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

In this case, manifest destiny, and the conquest and subjugation of Indigenous nations, undergirded the establishment of many of these health enterprises, especially those in the American west.

This way of seeing, in the case of sanitarium photographs and architectural diagrams ([1.2.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_3.html)), starts slipping out of the remit of this project, partly because of the limit of a medically focused sample.

Medicine and vision are diffuse, contested, ever evolving entities, and any clean demarcation of its boundaries is both factually and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

While doctors saw through their patients as a manifestation of symptoms, they also saw their patients as classed, raced, sexed, and abled ([1.3.5](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_5.html)). All of these ideas were entwined and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathologized</b></span>, under the logics of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Eugenics refers to a way of thinking that thinks that human society can bettered by selective reproduction.

The logic circumvents the more obvious economic and structural issues which, as a viewer from the twenty-first century, seem so obvious.

I am thinking in this way to articulate medicine in the same kind of diffuse way that I am framing <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span>: not in totalities but in intensities.[^fn2] A lot of why I look to this history of medicine is in interrogating the nested interdependencies of the then contemporary medical systems---health writ large[^fn3]---which extend and exploit the operations of white supremacy---<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Eugenics refers to a way of thinking that thinks that human society can bettered by selective reproduction.

Just as the bodies of poor subjects are the resource to be harvested (2.1.3; 4.1.3), so too is land to be built upon, made valuable, and ingested into the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods."><b>biomedical</b></span> project.[^fn4] Value, as I leverage it in this dissertation, refers to a network of potential benefits for the actors who extract it from their resources---in this case, from the land they claim, develop, and work upon. Value is leveraged in monetary gain, but also, importantly, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Cultural capital denotes the ways that cultural institutions and practices are used to maintain certain classed systems and structures."><b>cultural capital</b></span>,[^fn5] and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

Total arguments, like hard metals, are unscratchable but easily shattered, and diffuse arguments are malleable, but prone to imperfections.

The sanitarium is many things, from idyllic resort, to charity organization, from space of cure to location of research; it is, in all of these contexts also a space that needed to be built, that needed sufficient input by would be investors (public and private alike), and a space whose value has tended to be subsumed by American <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods."><b>biomedicine's</b></span> ever growing property portfolio. Again, though, this is a small portion of the many discourses that swirled about tuberculosis at the turn of the twentieth century. An institutional space, the sanitarium only factored as an arm of the larger war against the disease, one which was centrally addressed through the teaching of hygiene ([1.3.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_4.html)).	With this in mind, I will move away from the sanitarium to an examination of the discourses around hygiene and tuberculosis. These visual practices are distinct, being much more focused on a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathologizing</b></span> and dehumanizing approach to difference, but share a similar affinity to the sanitarium, as there is still a strange insistence on a patient's living space ([1.3.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_3.html)). Importantly too, these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

[^fn1]: My suspicion, which would require an entirely different research project to examine, is that over the course of a decades-long institution the cost of building a structure is quite low as compared to the cumulative annual operating costs, and that the presumed value of these buildings holds their value as opposed to the supposed wastefulness of paying others for their time and effort. Capital projects concretize and centralize value as opposed to disperse it among the laborers who would spend it elsewhere.

[^fn2]: Add some critical health humanities stuff.

[^fn3]: Add in health humanities readings
