The sanitarium was a prominent, but not singular, actor in the medical intervention against tuberculosis. Hospitals, dispensaries, and day camps (figs. 1 & 2), also played pivotal roles at this period, both treating and educating tuberculous patients (1.3.2). The sanitarium, however, was a central figure in the public imagination of tuberculosis and medical interventions against the disease, owing in part to the number of institutions which treated patients in the early twentieth century, the Romantic <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

Sanitorium treatment usually involved a retreat from the urban: for patients to travel to an institution located in some secluded space---Davos, Switzerland; the Adirondacks; the Rocky Mountains; Monrovia, California---which promised healing airs, the space for a rest cure, or the regimen of the working cure.[^fn2] These spaces often bordered the wilderness, promising an engagement with the outdoors and the contemplation of that space. Consumptive patients were encouraged to engage with the natural in an Emersonian way, where the wild and un-human space is a place of emotional and spiritual communion. As Ralph Waldo Emerson writes in *Nature*,

>In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,---no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground,---my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,---all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.[^fn3]

In this section from Emerson’s longer philosophical treatise, being embedded in the natural---the pristine and untouched spaces void of human intervention---enables a person’s connection to that space, affording a personal transcendence.

This sense of nature was a central calling for E. L. Trudeau, an avid outdoorsman and hunter, when he recovered in the Adirondacks:

>Here the mountains, covered with an unbroken frost, rose so abruptly from the river, and the sweep of the valley at their base was so extended and picturesque, that the view had always made a deep impression upon me. Many a beautiful afternoon, for the first four winters after I came to Saranac Lake, I had sat for hours alone while hunting, facing the ever-changing phases of light and shade on the imposing mountain panorama at my feet, and dreamed the dreams of youth; dreamed of life and death and God, and yearned for a closer contact with the Great Spirit who planned it all, and for light on the hidden meaning of our troublous existence. The grandeur and peace of it had ever brought refreshment to my perplexed spirit.[^fn4]

This connection to and engagement with the natural was likewise evoked in publications like *The Journal of Outdoor Life*. In a short-lived column, “The Naturalist”, that ran for two years, this contemplative, ecstatic engagement can be seen in a section describing the activities of woodpeckers:

>The earliest ectasy (sic) is that of a musician playing on his chosen instrument rather than that of a songster: but the performance must be considered as a song. The downy woodpecker heralds the awakening of nature long before those harbingers of spring, the bluebird and robin return. I did not hear him till late in February, and even then his efforts were casual and intermittent: now his achievements pervade the stillness, particularly in the morning and evening.[^fn5]

The sanitarium and the discourses around tuberculosis in America are tied to an escape from the urban, and with it a communion with the natural (1.3.2). In Emerson’s *Nature* it is the wilderness’ contrast with the city where the sharpest relief can be found. He writes, “In the wilderness, I find something more dear and connate than in streets or villages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature.”[^fn6] It is the sanitarium’s separation from the urban, its evocation of the bounties of the untamed lands (fig. 5), the careful examination of the wilderness (fig. 6), and a mixture of exposure and shelter from the elements (fig. 7 & 8). This latter example was entangled with the practices of “<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The open air approach to treating tuberculosis focused on the constant flow of fresh air.

In the tuberculosis corpus, the sanitarium was discussed in publications for tuberculous patients and lay observers, as well as in scientific journals and monographs. The focus of these features often mixed the description of specifically medical facilities at any given sanitorium, and the stately qualities of the institution. 

*The British Journal of Tuberculosis* had a pair of long running series which promoted health institutions in the United Kingdom and Europe. “Institutions for the Tuberculous” spotlighted various health resorts and facilities, providing information about more local hospitals. The first issue of the first volume described the facilities of the King Edward VII Sanatorium in Midhurst (figs. 11 & 12), the Brompton Hospital Sanatorium and Convalescent Home in Frimley (fig. 13), and the East Anglian Sanatorium in Suffolk (fig. 14).

For the facilities described “Institutions for the Tuberculous”, time is spent describing the amenities. The King Edward VII Sanatorium is described as having 

>2 hydropathic-rooms, 2 writing-rooms, 100 patients’ bedrooms (50 men and 50 women), with 6 nurses’ kitchens, linen-rooms, etc. The patients’ bedrooms measure 13 feet 6 inches by 11 feet 6 inches, and are 11 feet high. The large windows open out on a balcony 8 feet in width.[^fn7]

These more rote descriptions are matched with descriptions of the dining facilities---“The dining hall is a handsome room, lined with Doulton Carrera ware, the floor being of stone, which can be heated from beneath”[^fn8]---and description of the institution’s research facilities---“The pathological block consists of a post-mortem-room and thee well-appointed rooms for pathological and research work. Researches which have a direct bearing upon the treatment of consumption will form an important feature of this department.”[^fn9] In a journal that aims toward an academic, scientific audience, the emphasis on the space as a curative agent gets folded into a means of promotion.

The King Edward VII Sanatorium presented itself in such a way because it was unlike other institutions. As Vincent Y. Bowditch states in a puff piece on British sanatoria for *The Journal of Outdoor Life*, “the sanatorium is not a charitable institution in the strict sense of the word, it being the wish of King Edward that wealthy patients should be accommodated as well as other less well-to-do people.”[^fn10] With rooms running as much as five guineas (or around $26) a week[^fn11] and costing as little as two pounds two shillings (or around $10.50) for a week of care,[^fn12] the sanatorium was hoping to serve middle to upper class patients.[^fn13] As treatment was costly, the luxurious framing helped sell the sanatorium to the journal’s audience---doctors and medical practitioners---about how the environment might benefit their tuberculous patients. The entries for “Institutions for the Tuberculous” read as ways for the professional practitioners to learn about potential facilities to send their patients, with brief descriptions of the amenties which could be used to persuade a sick patient to go there.

It was also likely that patients who were sick with the disease, or families of those who were sick, would look to the quasi-advertisements of sanatoria published in medical journals, or in collected books of sanatoria like the *Hand Book of Help for Persons Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) Directory of Tuberculosis Hospitals Sanatoria and Clinics* published in 1915 by New York City’s Department of Health or Lilian Brandt’s 1904 book *A Directory of Institutions and Societies Dealing with Tuberculosis in the United States and Canada*.  Brandt, writing in the introduction to the latter monograph, says that the book was “designed, first, to serve as a guide to the physicians and friends of consumptives, whether poor or well-to-do, by furnishing accurate information in regard to existing institutions”.[^fn14] Many of the images in the corpus come from these kinds of publications, which are not scientific but speak to an audience to whom practicing doctors were a main constituent.

Brandt’s directory, like *The British Journal of Tuberculosis*, uses photographs to make its argument. There are images of buildings, nestled comfortably in the landscape (fig. 8, 15), empty and sterile rooms for rest and socialization (figs. 16 & 17), and relatively few images that actually show patients (fig. 18). Curiously, sometimes it looks like patients who are in the frame are left as an afterthought in relation to displaying the luxurious space of the sanitorium (figs. 18 & 19).

I use the *British Journal of Tuberculosis* and Brandt’s directory as examples of a common practice. *These images of tuberculosis facilities do not show care* *they show space*. Usually this is inflected with a mix of luxury and Romanticism. 

In my analysis, I have used language associated with consumption in this case study. Not referring to the tuberclous consumption, I instead meant to point to consumption as it is used in relation to commodities. These images are advertisements. These images sell the sanatorium. I have also used this language to imply a relationship between these images and another non-clinical practice occurring in this <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

These images do not just correspond to spaces of healing, but also the result of capital investment, be it by private enterprises or non-profit community organizations ([1.2.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_4.html)). These photographs document the buildings themselves, either in their newly built glory, or in the retrofitted spaces where some sanataria were developed.[^fn15]
