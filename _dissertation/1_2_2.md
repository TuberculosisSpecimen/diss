The sanitarium was a prominent, but not singular, actor in the medical intervention against tuberculosis. Hospitals, dispensaries, and day camps (figs. 1 & 2), also played pivotal roles at this period, both treating and educating tuberculous patients ([1.3.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_2.html)). The sanitarium, however, was a central figure in the public imagination of tuberculosis and medical interventions against the disease, owing in part to the number of institutions which treated patients in the early twentieth century, the Romantic <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

Thomas Mann's *The Magic Mountain* was modelled on this kind of idyllic health resort. *The British Journal of Tuberculosis*. (London: Ballière, Tindall & Cox, 1911), 46.

Sanitorium treatment usually involved a retreat from the urban: for patients to travel to an institution located in some secluded space---Davos, Switzerland; the Adirondacks; the Rocky Mountains; Monrovia, California---which promised healing airs, the space for a rest cure, or the regimen of the working cure.[^fn2] These spaces often bordered the wilderness, promising an engagement with the outdoors and the contemplation of that space. Consumptive patients were encouraged to engage with the natural in an Emersonian way, where the wild and un-human space is a place of emotional and spiritual communion. As Ralph Waldo Emerson writes in *Nature*,

>In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,---no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground,---my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,---all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God.[^fn3]

In this section from Emerson's longer philosophical treatise, being embedded in the natural---the pristine and untouched spaces void of human intervention---enables a person's connection to that space, affording a personal transcendence.

This sense of nature was a central calling for E. L. Trudeau, an avid outdoorsman and hunter, when he recovered in the Adirondacks:

>Here the mountains, covered with an unbroken frost, rose so abruptly from the river, and the sweep of the valley at their base was so extended and picturesque, that the view had always made a deep impression upon me. Many a beautiful afternoon, for the first four winters after I came to Saranac Lake, I had sat for hours alone while hunting, facing the ever-changing phases of light and shade on the imposing mountain panorama at my feet, and dreamed the dreams of youth; dreamed of life and death and God, and yearned for a closer contact with the Great Spirit who planned it all, and for light on the hidden meaning of our troublous existence. The grandeur and peace of it had ever brought refreshment to my perplexed spirit.[^fn4]

This connection to and engagement with the natural was likewise evoked in publications like *The Journal of Outdoor Life*. In a short-lived column, "The Naturalist", that ran for two years, this contemplative, ecstatic engagement can be seen in a section describing the activities of woodpeckers:

>The earliest ectasy (sic) is that of a musician playing on his chosen instrument rather than that of a songster: but the performance must be considered as a song. The downy woodpecker heralds the awakening of nature long before those harbingers of spring, the bluebird and robin return. I did not hear him till late in February, and even then his efforts were casual and intermittent: now his achievements pervade the stillness, particularly in the morning and evening.[^fn5]

The sanitarium and the discourses around tuberculosis in America are tied to an escape from the urban, and with it a communion with the natural ([1.3.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_2.html)). In Emerson's *Nature* it is the wilderness' contrast with the city where the sharpest relief can be found. He writes, "In the wilderness, I find something more dear and connate than in streets or villages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature."[^fn6] It is the sanitarium's separation from the urban, its evocation of the bounties of the untamed lands (fig. 5), the careful examination of the wilderness (fig. 6), and a mixture of exposure and shelter from the elements (fig. 7 & 8). This latter example was entangled with the practices of "<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The open air approach to treating tuberculosis focused on the constant flow of fresh air. It was often paired with the rest cure."><b>pen air treatment</b></span>"---a therapy that required patients to be outside, or exposed to fresh air, for as many hours as possible each day (figs. 9 & 10).
