# 1.1.1 Tuberculous Cultures

In developing the corpus and image dataset for this dissertation (0.x.x; x.1.x), I ran across a bulk of images that surprised me. <span class="opaque-lines">Out of the thousands of images which my coders and I processed a huge percentage of them [around 50% at present count] had little to do with the kinds of examination which rely on an extractivist construction of the specimen</span> (0.x.x). What does a <span class="opaque-lines">child selling postage seals </span>(fig. 1), an architectural floor-plan for a sanatorium (fig. 2), an image of a filthy room (fig. 3), <span class="opaque-lines"><span class="partial-lines">images of children studying in heavy coats</span></span> (fig. 4), and a photograph of a cottage (fig. 5) have to do with the scientific understandings of the disease? What about a photograph of idyllic mountain resort (fig. 6), a portrait of a doctor taken for a conference (fig. 7), or a graphic of a flapper dancing with death (fig. 8) have to do with the ways doctors saw and treated their patients?

This chapter addresses this surprising observation with a series of questions: what are some of the broader assumptions which encircle the treatment of tuberculosis? How are these reproduced in visual media? How do they display differing visual practices in the history of medicine? And in what ways do these images reinforce the classist, racist, and ableist <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to the implicitly assumed knowledge which is taken for granted in a given culture.

I ask these questions first because of the implicit connections between tuberculosis research and the other cultural actors producing images. Some of the visual material is closely related to scientific research, as with the cases of material in public-facing magazines published by sanataria with research capabilities (*The Sanatorium* and the first few volumes of *The Journal of Outdoor Life*). Other materials were linked to public health and volunteer organizations like the Anti-Tuberculosis Health League or the Charity Organization Society of the City of New York, and others are public-facing books that are meant to help tuberculous patients find sanataria, understand how to treat their loved ones, or provide help about hygiene. Beyond this, even more images come from self published or regionally published materials that may or may not have any association with the broader scientific discourses around the disease.  This broad range of publications speaks also to a wide array of writers and readers, and where a visual practice like the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze is an ocular practice formulated in post-revolutionary France, and describes the way doctors are trained to see their patients.

My interest for this chapter is to try to wrangle the sometimes disparate threads which knot around tuberculosis in this period. This chapter makes two arguments: first, in response to the excellent scholarship by my peers who analyze medicine and its cultures, I stress a need to look at medical visual culture in the plural. Medicine has not, and never has had, a singular <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture is an interdisciplinary field of research that examines the ways culture produces and enforces certain viewing practices.

Future scholarship will help nuance, rebuke, and clarify the claims I make this chapter.<label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">A good example of the broad discourses around health can be seen in the double issue of *Camera Obscura* on medicine and film edited by Paula A.

Second, by engaging with the broader cultures around tuberculosis, I hope to onboard readers to some main themes which will become more prominent in the next two chapters. I am going to follow three three mini-case studies---on hygiene, the sanatorium, and the medical practitioner at work---to define some ideological through-lines which will reappear in the next two chapters (2.0.0; 3.0.0). In doing this, my hope is to articulate in clear detail the eugenicist and capitalistic ideas which were reified in the process of fighting the disease. Concepts of class, ability, cleanliness, and health appear in relation to the cultural conception of tuberculosis, as well as the popular and scientific understandings regarding treatment. As Linda Bryder has argued, tuberculosis doctors in the early twentieth century "showed themselves to be very much a product of the middle-class society from which they came, with its fixed assumptions about the poor",<label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">Bryder, Linda. *Below the Magic Mountain: A Social History of Tuberculosis in Twentieth-Century Britain*.
