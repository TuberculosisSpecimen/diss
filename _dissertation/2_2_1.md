In the introduction to this dissertation, I mentioned how the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> museum at the Henry Phipps Institute quickly outgrew the space that had originally been designated for specimen storage. The photograph that accompanied this history displayed a collection of brains in the foreground, and the medical scientists who worked in this space in the background (fig. 1) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_1_1">0.1.1</a>). While not hugely common, photographers sometimes caught doctors in their labs, with human remains on display in the *mise en scene* (fig. 2) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_1">1.4.1</a>).[^fn1]

For the Henry Phipps Institute photograph (fig. 1), the materials were certainly acquired through posthumous examination: the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid. Contemporary wet specimens are usually submerged in a formalin mixture, and older specimens from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were usually preserved in a spirit like rum or whiskey."><b>wet specimens</b></span> on display were brains. They were collected under the assumption that they might be valuable for research, with specific interest in understanding the fast-moving meningeal tuberculosis, which affected the brain. Also known as galloping tuberculosis, a patient with this rarer form of the disease would have weeks, rather than months or years before succumbing to the infection (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_3">2.2.3</a>).

The human material preserved in these jars were useful for many reasons, as they could be removed for close inspection and microscopic study.[^fn2] My interest is in seeing <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid.

While many of the images that I look at in this section are photographs, the production of those images depends on different technological and methodological practices.

>At each stage of Braune and Fischer’s experiment, they had to make adjustments to the subject, the apparatus, and the means of analysis. The recruit’s body, for example, had to be continually manipulated and adjusted to create a legible image. Indeed, just as adapting the subject’s body to the apparatus, and vice versa, played a large role in creating and legitimating a scientiﬁc image, so adapting labor to the machine age was the primary goal of the science of work. Likewise, Braune and Fischer’s intricate efforts to prepare the military recruit for his mission correspond nicely with the mathematical contortions required to translate the image into acceptable scientiﬁc data. Understanding the mechanics of the human body required its submission and disassembly on both sides of the equation, before and after the chronophotographic inscription.[^fn6]

In an uncharacteristic moment of clarity around a single archival object, Sigmund Freud’s family bible and the inscription written by the psychoanalyst’s father, Derrida describes how the residual, historical, inscriptive possibility of the archive is enacted:

>A gift carried this inscription. What the father gives to the son is at once a writing and its substrate. The substrate, in a sense, was the Bible itself, the ‘Book of books,’ a Philippsohn Bible Sigmund had studied in his youth. His father restores it to him, after having made a present of it to him; he restitutes it as a gift, with a new leather binding. To bind anew: this is an act of love. Of paternal love.[^fn8]
