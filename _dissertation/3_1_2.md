“The Modern Orpheus” shows the beginnings of a broader career using <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method.

When I began “The Modern Orpheus” my training had not equipped me with the tools to properly unpack, describe, reflect on, and process what I was seeing. I find myself thinking about how addressing images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as impossible. A decade after the first cut of the film, I am still unsure how best to address the material; I am unsure as to whether the decisions I made were the right, proper, or ethical ones. In writing this dissertation, designing the digital platform, and working on a series of art projects which I will describe in this chapter, the correct approach to a history of violence whose wounds are still so obviously open seems impossible to find.[^fn1]

The impossibility I evoke when describing “The Modern Orpheus” was one in which my methodological, theoretical, and conceptual toolkit---built as it was through a degree in literature and film studies---was so completely unprepared to address the brutal, violent, exploitative content onto which I had stumbled. Sylvia Wynter addresses this in regard to the limits of academic knowledge work. She asks, 

>how can we come to know our social reality, no longer in the terms of the abductive order-legitimating ‘knowledge of categories’ system of thought (Althusser’s Ideology) to which the code lawlikely [sic] gives rise, but heretically, in terms of ‘knowledge of the world as it is’?[^fn2]

She asks, how can we view the ground of social reality, as it is made through operations of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

How can we view social reality which is inescapable and self-producing, outside the confines of the predetermined views already established? For the Black critical theorist, she defines a loose method: the autopoetic turn/overturn. This method is a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Reflexivity refers to ability for researchers to reflect and comment on their own biases and problems as a method to improve their research."><b>reflexive</b></span> possibility afforded by an inspection of the foundational myths of knowing---tied to biohistories and Darwinian <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

The impossible is itself an opportunity to address the unspoken, implicit, and predetermining factors which frame knowledge’s possibilities. “The Modern Orpheus” and the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method.

These methods are a means to test preconceptions about specific subject matter in a way that more standardized methodologies may be unable to conceptually grasp; they are also a means of imagining potential other methods, frameworks, and approaches.

Moreover, this notion of impossibility that I am discussing comes out a broader limitation of my education: that my <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

Guilt is not as much a weight---an albatross around my neck---so much as a methodological choice. Guilt functions as a driving force, which arises as an unsettling between my privileged, white, cis male, abled view and responds to an obvious harm enacted on the bodies of othered, raced, disabled, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research.

Guilt does not allow “settler moves to innocence”---the “strategies or positionings that attempt to relieve the settler of feelings of guilt or responsibility without giving up land or power or privilege, without having to change much at all.”[^fn5]

Guilt is incommensurable with our academic system, because it assumes that maybe our research should not be done in the first place (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3}}">4.2.3</a>). It forces us to ask whether we are reifying, perpetuating, and remaking systemic violences.[^fn6] Guilt is a moment of vulnerability, which the hazing activities of peer review, doctoral exams and dissertations, hiring processes and tenure review can point to as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

I feel that I need to show these harms to articulate my argument, but more importantly, I show these harms because without them I would be unable to pass a dissertation defense. I do not image my committee would be happy to review a document that has been entirely redacted. My guilt, for this dissertation especially, helps me be more honest about the difficulties of academic work, the complexity of the projects that I had undertaken, and the seeming impossibility of meaningful change (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/5_1_4}}">5.1.4</a>).
