As I developed the .css and .html inputs, I spent time looking at images from the same collection of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Dermatological atlases are books published with images to show the general symptoms related to dermatological conditions. Doctors use these atlases to help diagnose patients."><b>dermatological atlases</b></span> that I had sampled from for <i>Terminal Imaginaries</i> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_1">3.2.1</a>). While returning to these texts, I created a brief list of selects. This is a process which I learned about from documentary video editing. Often with documentary footage, there is far too much material for one person to go over, and so usually an assistant editor will look over the totality of video collected for a project and flag takes or clips from that footage as being worthy of inspection by the main editor. These selects make the process of doing an assembly cut---or the first overly long edit with little to no care to the flow of the piece---more approachable.[^fn1] Through this process I began to think of the images in two ways: first, I started to train myself to try to see the interventions of doctors: their hands and tools which held a body still for examination (fig. 1) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_2">1.4.2</a>). I became interested in thinking of the various ways the bodies of patients were made docile for photographic capture (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>).[^fn2]

My second interest came by way of thinking through the Foucauldian notion of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy. This process alienates the patient, turning them into a collection of pathologies rather than a human person."><b>clinical gaze</b></span>---or the ocular practice that abstracts a patient’s symptoms against an idealized human anatomy, alienating and dehumanizing the patient in the process (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_2">1.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>). Just as the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy.

What struck me, and what still strikes me as I write this, is that there seemed to be a secondary connection between <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

More simply, a photograph of a rash, like <i>lupus vulgaris</i>, may be helpful for a doctor, but it is more helpful if the doctor understands where on the patient it formed, and to what scale on their body it manifested. The context matters, and in the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Dermatological atlases are books published with images to show the general symptoms related to dermatological conditions.

These two observations helped me layer <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacities</b></span> as a framing device. Where the previous installation, <i>Terminal Imaginaries</i> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_1">3.2.1</a>), thought through anonymity, or lack thereof, in the dermatological photograph, “Dermographic Opacities” began a strand of thinking whereby the absense of visual material could be leveraged to make an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

The mouseover functionality called attention to the presence of the doctor, scientist, assistant, or other discursive element that kept a patient sitting (fig. 1), and the on-click functionality helped distill the otherwise abstract aspect of the disease itself (fig. 2) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_2">3.3.2</a>).

[^fn1]: I did the same kind of approach to images for this dissertation. During the creation of the image dataset (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_1_3">X.1.3</a>), I will flag specific images as selects (which is both marked on the file and in the dataset itself), so I will have a smaller collection of images to look through to find examples.
