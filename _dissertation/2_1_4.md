I begin this chapter with this case study as a concrete, but non-human, example of the kind of relationship which I will describe later in this chapter. This chapter stresses the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use this term, 'material', to connect my thinking to new materialism, a philosophical posthuman approach which sees nonhuman agents in the world as having distinct agencies.

I stress Koch’s animal testing as a shorthand to consider medical science’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necroepistemic refers to the ways deathmaking practices are leveraged in the process of knowledge creation."><b>necroepistemic</b></span> dependencies.

What matters for my analysis of Koch was the way death was a necessary, productive process for his research agenda.

Jill Casid describes how carceral, colonial, white supremacist capitalism produces death in ways that benefits itself: the obliteration of cultures, species, bodies, histories is all a productive part of its all-consuming expansionism. “Undoing” is not just a means of making die, so much as a way to make die and reform again, and Casid sees this process as one of potential intervention.[^fn5] For extractivist colonial <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

For Koch’s research, deathmaking is a necessary step. The guinea pig’s corpse provides proof or absence of the tuberculosis infection, which can then be mined again for subsequent injections, autopsies, and microscopic investigations (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_2">2.1.2</a>). It is a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necroepistemic refers to the ways deathmaking practices are leveraged in the process of knowledge creation."><b>necroepistemic</b></span> relation because the experiment depends on the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.
