The series of art works which I address in this chapter were produced by me in 2021 and 2022. These project specifically deal with conceptual and ethical problems in the history of medicine, and used humanist-facing, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method.

The concerns about the sick patient, their subjugation under a series of overlapping gazes, and an ethical imperative to reframe and remake these images stretches over close to a decade of creative work. I will focus on three projects---*Terminal Imaginaries* (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_1">3.2.1</a>) and *Tuberculous Imaginaries* (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_4">3.2.4</a>), and “Dermographic Opacities” (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_1">3.3.1</a>). These successive projects show a series of different approaches to the medical image, as they range from projector-based installations to a digital photo essay. I will use my own writing, as it appeared in grants, blog posts, and the public facing websites for each of these projects to help frame what I was thinking when developing the work. I will also address the gaps and concerns I now see with that line of thinking. 

What I will show through these reflective case studies is a progression in my approach to the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

Being exploratory in nature, these projects show how the open-ended qualities of arts-based reflection helped sharpen my understanding of these materials.

Ultimately, I use these case studies to consider how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method.

[^fn1]: The gap between the 2016 film and these more contemporary projects is the result of a personal and creative rut experienced after finishing my MFA in 2016. That degree left me hollow and unable to produce creative work for a number of years.

[^fn2]: This phrasing is distinct from the use of “practice-based research” I use in the next chapter. I feel it is valuable to think about “arts-based” as a smaller subset of the “practice-based” approaches in broader fields, especially because it is distinct from digital humanist practice-based methods, which focus more on the development of tools.
