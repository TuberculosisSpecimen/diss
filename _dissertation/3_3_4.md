In articulating <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span> at the end of the last section (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_3}}">3.3.3</a>), I found myself split between how I view these terms now, and how I understood and used these terms when writing “Dermographic Opacities”. In some ways that project and the Opaque Online Publishing Platform (OOPP)---the platform which was developed to host this dissertation (4.0.1)---see <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> similarly: it is an analytical method, which proves useful for critical, necessary scholarship in the history of medicine. While this is true, this positions assumes that the reason why one might engage in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span>, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Refusal refers to the moments, actions, and possibilities enabled by denying academic access to personal, cultural, or spiritual materials and knowledge."><b>refusal</b></span>-based methodologies because it is for the benefit of future knowledge work. While this may be true, and is certainly how I imagined “Dermographic Opacities” when I wrote it in 2022, it overshadows the more important ethical concern at the center of this dissertation.

The problem is that the ethical demands of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span>---the respect for the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term 'research subject' to refer to a specific relationship between a researcher and the person or people they research. The 'subject' is a pun on the monarchal subject, someone who has no agency under the spectacular power of the sovereign. In this relationship, the researcher has power over their research subject to define and describe the person within a set knowledge system."><b>research subject</b></span>, their interiority, their exclusion from knowledge systems---are antithetical to a claim that announces the improvement of scholarly methods. My argument in “Dermographic Opacities” still produces scholarship that depends on the extraction of information, even if what I am collecting is reduced, reframed, and reimagined.[^fn1]

Where the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span> functioned as a method in the “Dermographic Opacities” essay, my relationship has continued to shift. My approach is defined by ethic of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span>, which is undergirded by a deep skepticism regarding the ultimate utility of the academic project (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_4_1}}">3.4.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_4_3}}">3.4.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/5_1_3}}">5.1.3</a>). In reflecting on this essay, I see that I still imagined the images as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span>, ones which could be reassessed, but which ultimately were valuable to me and my professional research. In the years following its publication, I am trying to imagine a relationship which is not extractive, and the OOPP, which is ambivalent toward the outputs of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> and which I will describe in the next chapter (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_1_1}}">4.1.1</a>), feels like a helpful step.

I bring this tension forward to tease out an implicit <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>ideology</b></span> at play, with which I am negotiating. Ethics do not too often guide method, so much as function as a check box to mark as scholars do their research, especially as they navigate the requirements of an institutional review board (IRB) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/5_1_2}}">5.1.2</a>). In this way ethics are secondary to knowledge work. In articulating an ethical standard as being generative, I maintain this secondary relationship. I am basically saying that only if ethics helps me make ‘novel’ work does it have a place in my research.

I tease this problem out, because it conveys an important difference between this project and the OOPP. It also helps me clarify how my understanding and relationship to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> has shifted, and how the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Iterative, here, refers to a process of learning in which completed projects are analyzed after their completion. This analysis allows for future projects to be more successful, and to address new, but related concepts."><b>iterative</b></span> approach to creative work has changed my theoretical understanding of knowledge work. 

The problem of ethics in the context of research is the same problem I see for arts-based interventions: what are we to do with them if they are not <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

[^fn1]: I also am still trying to produce a hit piece that critiques medicine in a way that does not imagine the scientists as wholly realized individuals.
