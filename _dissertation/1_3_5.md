Overlapping much of the sanatarium and hygienic interventions discussed in this section and the previous one (1.2.0), is the participation of medical professionals in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourses</b></span> of social engineering. Tuberculosis was not a singular object which could be stopped in the body of a single patient; it was instead an invasive body (2.3.4) that reproduces, manifests in different hosts, and presents a threat to a broader social fabric---be it state, national, or international groups. Seeded in these arguments is a notion of the body politic, which views the health of a community in broad strokes and engineers solutions to address the subject in aggregate. These arguments articulate a pernicious notion of disease by way of foreign aggressor, which if not properly handled could and would invade the bodies of the ruling class. The control of disease was displaced onto the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject refers to a single human actor who has been made into a researchable object within a knowledge system."><b>subject</b></span> themsleves, they were made to blame for becoming ill, and then made to blame for making others sick.

This can be seen most obviously in a report published by the state of Virginia's tuberculosis commission in 1915. They write, 

>The careful consumptive, who has been taught not to spread his germs, and who wishes to save other people from his fate, is not dangerous, but on the contrary, is a valuable aid in teaching the important facts relating to tuberculosis. On the other hand, the wilfully [sic] ignorant and criminally careless consumptives spread their disease widely and are more dangerous than mad dogs. In the interest of public welfare, we recommend legislation which will effectually restrain the criminally ignorant and criminally careless consumptives.[^fn1]

Personal responsibility becomes a way to dodge blame for the more pernicious, systemic issues at play: the way doctors seem unable to imagine how disease is related to class, environment, and health.[^fn2] It is the untrained, uneducated <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject refers to a single human actor who has been made into a researchable object within a knowledge system."><b>subject</b></span> who is to blame for their own disease, and then it is the willful refusal of that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject refers to a single human actor who has been made into a researchable object within a knowledge system."><b>subject</b></span> to be made docile that leads to the spread of the disease.

The hygienic system produced <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject refers to a single human actor who has been made into a researchable object within a knowledge system."><b>subjects</b></span> and trained them in the manners and an aesthetics of cleanliness, but always with a judgemental air. If the patient could not conform to the regiments of the charity sanitarium, they were either asked to leave or would leave themselves ([1.3.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_4.html)).[^fn3] If patients used provided charity in a way that was unexpected or seemed otherwise ungrateful, they were chastened.[^fn4] The gaze which is produced in this context is a kind of projection: an imagined pollutant in the form of an uncontrolled body must be <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense.

Considering the subjects denied care in charity organizations for not behaving according to the rules of care ([1.3.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_4.html)), the denial of care in terms of a chronic disease like tuberculosis not only permits the subject to spread the disease  also denies that subject potential life-saving or life-extending care.

Deeply racist, eugenicists forwarded the procreation of white subjects while sterilizing, denying healthcare to, and outwardly killing populations thought to be of a danger to the social order."><b>eugenics</b></span> responded to a series of Gregor Mendell-influenced studies in the ways traits were passed in human reproduction. Harriet Washington gives a succinct summary:

>Galton first formulated the desirability of using selective procreation to refine the human race while conquering social dysfunction. This goal was widely embraced on both scientific and popular levels by the 1930s, not only in the United States, but also abroad, and eugenic yardsticks were applied to not only populations but to individuals. Eugenicists proposed that society use medical information about disease and trait inheritance to end social ills by encouraging the birth of children with good, healthy, and beautiful traits.[^fn9]

Important for tuberculosis in the period of this study, was that the undercurrent of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourses</b></span> around the disease were centered around the protection of certain populations, be they working laborers or the white ruling class. Returning to Virginia's 1915 report, this logic can explicitly seen. The authors write,

>Since the greatest number of deaths and the greatest number of living cases occur among the negro race, since the relations between the two races are so intimate that a communicable disease affecting the negro must in a grave measure affect the white, since there is not a bed maintained by the State at present for a negro consumptive except in the State Asylum and Penitentiary, we would respectfully urge, for both humanitarian and economic reasons, that a sum of not less than $40,000 be appropriated for the immediate construction of a State sanatorium for the negro consumptive.[^fn13]

Hygiene and public health, as they are constructed in this report, are used to protect a *specific* race of subjects separate from the Black patients they sought to institutionalize. In the example images shown in the preceding sections ([1.3.1](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_1.html); [1.3.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_2.html); [1.3.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_4.html)), the hygienic gaze was one that expressed anxiety over the supposedly unwashed nonwhite, lower-class <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject refers to a single human actor who has been made into a researchable object within a knowledge system."><b>subject</b></span> that endangered the lives of the hygienic upperclass by their very proximity. Establishing moral failure was a means to give an excuse to why the lower class may be allowed to die.[^fn14] Designating who is clean and unclean, healthy and unhealthy works into an imagined idealization of the<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject refers to a single human actor who has been made into a researchable object within a knowledge system."><b> subject[^fn15]</b></span> but there is a secondary engineering at play: the moralization of how one is allowed to live or die. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>Necropower</b></span> functions as such: "the new technologies of destruction are less concerned with inscribing bodies within disciplinary apparatuses than with inscribing them, when the time comes, within the order of the maximal economy now represented by the 'massacre.'"[^fn16]

The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use aesthetics to describe how representational practices overlap with taste arguments, and how the way representation is coded with a specific meaning for audiences in the middle and upper class."><b>aesthetics</b></span> of hygiene, and the hygienic gaze articulated in this section, proliferates a deeply <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Eugenics refers to a way of thinking that thinks that human society can bettered by selective reproduction.

[^fn6]: I am thinking in regards to the socially acceptability of masking over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic and afterwards. The proper procedures to mitigate the spread of the disease slipped and shifted. Partly this was because of misunderstandings and miscommunications by national health organizations, and partly this was due to the politicization of the disease and masking.

[^fn7]: Again, the Covid-19 pandemic has so many rhymes [!!!Add definition] because the very subjects I am writing about in that pandemic were the ones violently refusing to mask, get vaccines, or social distance for the life of their peers.

[^fn12]: While different in what constitutes a "good" subject, the ways tuberculosis remains a factor in excluding immigrants from entry into the United States, also has an aesthetics. That one is associated with the ability to see, through clinical vision, the manifetation of tuberculous symptoms in an x-ray of the lungs.

[^fn14]: As the Covid-19 pandemic haunts this section, I wonder if I can square this logic a bit, because the most vitriolic and pernicious anti-mask and anti-vax rhetorics seem to bloom from eugenicist logics employed by the Trump administration. Its early spread in the United States was tied to urban centers with largely black populations, and its attatchment to anti-Asian hate (dubbed by president Donald Trump as the "China virus") points to a race-based eugenics that runs in parallel to narratives of the disease. These narratives seem to say, "it will only kill the inferior (non-white) stock".
	
	Perhaps, too, my handwringing here is concerned with the extrapolation of what is a historical argument (about tuberculosis) onto a different historical moment (regarding Covid-19).
