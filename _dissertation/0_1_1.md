In 1903, Henry Phipps---a robber baron who made his millions working for the Carnegie Steel Company---opened a research hospital in Philadelphia specializing in care for patients with who could not afford medical care. Having picked Lawrence F. Flick, a well regarded doctor who had previously run the White Haven Sanatorium, the Henry Phipps Institute sought to care for the city’s consumptive patients, offering free care, a dispensary, and additional aid. A charity institution and research hospital, it also studied the patients under its care.

As part of this project, the doctors at the Henry Phipps Institute took detailed notes about their patients, and when a patient died in their care, their body was autopsied. In the institute’s second annual report, Flick made a nonchalant comment about their growing medical museum: 

>Long before the end of the first year the Institute had reached the full capacity of its quarters and had used every available foot of floor space for some useful purpose. The building had gradually shaped itself along lines of utility until every part of it had been used for that purpose to which it was best adapted and for which it could be used with least friction and inconvenience. The nurses had already been crowded out of the building and the space which had been set aside for laboratory work and for a pathological museum was rapidly growing inadequate.[^fn1]

When Flick writes of the institute’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> museum, he is referencing to the institute’s collection of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid.

The overflowing collections were the result of an influx of human material taken from dead patients, which promised to be of some use for scientific research.

Operating on a new model of philanthropy established by John D. Rockefeller’s medical research institute, the Phipps Institute both sought to cure patients with tuberculosis, while also using them for research. As Barbara Bates tells it, Flick’s ambitious plan saw the linkage of patient care and medical research as necessary to the disease’s eventual conquest. She writes, “Out of [the Institute’s] dispensary and hospital would come the materials for the scientific laboratory, and from the knowledge accumulated in all three places there would develop some new answers to the old disease.”[^fn2] While teaching hospitals had often used their patients as material for research and education,[^fn3] the Phipps Institute targeted tuberculosis specifically, seeing every patient that entered its doors as a potential <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.

The doctors of the Phipps Institute treated hundreds of patients, with 150 people dying in the first two years of operation. Of those who died 143 were autopsied, and their remains, taken piecemeal as necessary, quickly overfilled the museum.

The Henry Phipps Institute’s specimen collection was not an outlier, but the commonly held best practice for doing medical research. Anatomical and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> museums had, for a century, been a central part of medical education. In the nineteenth century, the best medical schools were determined because of their extensive or famous collections.[^fn4] These materials were often accumulated through theft, and they were the backbone of a myriad of entwined disciplines, with medicine and anthropology being the most egregious practitioners. More often than not, especially in the United States, the human remains used for <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

The Henry Phipps Institute, and the medical community broadly at the turn of the twentieth century, represents the problem that this dissertation addresses: the body of a sick, dying, or dead patient was <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.
