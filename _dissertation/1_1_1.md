Susan Sontag’s <i>Illness as Metaphor</i> examines the ways sick individuals are viewed following a diagnosis with a disease. Written after her own experience with breast cancer, the essay reflects on how isolating and stigmatizing it was to go through chemotherapy treatment in the 1970s. She thought about the kinds of language that was used around cancer, and the ways the disease was represented in the contemporary <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discourse</b></span>. Her essay was, also, a comparative one, using tuberculosis at the turn of the twentieth century as a foil. Tuberculosis was popularly conceived as a wasting disease, for Romantics, poets and artists who burnt out young, as they frenziedly lost weight until they were left bedridden and on death’s door (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_1">1.2.1</a>). She writes,

>TB sufferers may be represented as passionate but are, more characteristically, deficient in vitality, in life force. . . . TB is celebrated as the disease of born victims, of sensitive, passive people who are not quite life-loving enough to survive. . . . And while the standard representation of a death from TB places the emphasis on the perfected sublimation of feeling, the recurrent figure of the tubercular courtesan indicates that TB was also thought to make the sufferer sexy.[^fn1]

Sontag played with popular imaginations of tuberculosis not only to comparatively reflect on the alienation she felt as a cancer patient, but also to think about how the sick are conisidered at a cultural scale: the ideas about specific diseases manifest in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

In some ways the essay fits well next to the critiques of Phillipe Ariés, Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, and Cisely Saunders, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Death studies is an interdisciplinary field that thinks about how death informs and is informed by cultural practices.

Tuberculosis is an excellent choice to use as a prop and contrast for Sontag’s essay. The disease is not a straw man in Sontag’s argument, as it is broad enough and so present in the public consciousness that, even after the advent of antibiotics, most people are aware of its history and cultural impact.[^fn3] Not unlike its recurring infection in the body of a patient, tuberculosis always returns: by way of the AIDS crisis, the advancement of drug resistant TB, and global inequities in care.[^fn4] The disease remains in the public consciousness, both in the recollections of loved ones who have memories of family members with the disease,[^fn5] but also in the ways tuberculosis is leveraged as a exclusion agent (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_5">1.3.5</a>). Many of my colleagues who traveled to the United States for school have told me about the mandatory TB screenings they had to take before they could be allowed in the country.[^fn6] The popular imagination of the disease resides as an afterimage, nestled into <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

This luminescent remnant was produced as a result of broader cultural, scientific, and governmental forces, which focused on tuberculosis in the late nineteenth century. Such images of tuberculosis were produced in equal measure by a change in knowledge around the disease (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>), by the popularization of the sanatorium[^fn7] treatment (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_1">1.2.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_3">1.2.3</a>), by the adoption of germ theory (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_1">2.1.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_2">2.1.2</a>), by the emergence of public health approaches to medicine (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_1">1.3.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_4">1.3.4</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_5">1.3.5</a>), and by an active volunteer network fighting to rid the nation of tuberculosis.

This popular and social understanding was informed by, and in turn influenced, the scientific imagination of the disease. I use the phrase scientific imagination to stress the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

These conceptions of heredity, as well as ideas regarding a set limit of energy a human had in their lifespan, persisted into the twentieth century, with familial disposition to the disease becoming a central conceit for germ versus soil arguments[^fn11]---where the embodied disposition of a patient was thought to be more important for a tuberculosis infection than <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> itself (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_5">1.3.5</a>).[^fn12]

An imagined version of tuberculosis does not loom large in the medical memory alone, though. It is also present in the popular imagination, in part due to these cultural influences and in part due to its ebb and flow as a problem in global health.[^fn13] While readers of this dissertation may have lingering memories of the disease, it is also situated in a significant in a broader historical and cultural context which an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term interdisciplinary (as opposed to multidisciplinary) in this dissertation to convey how different methodologies and frameworks guide my research."><b>interdisciplinary</b></span> audience may only be aware of in passing. 

Perhaps most important is that, in the development of the dataset for this dissertation (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_1_3">X.1.3</a>), I found myself inundated with images that did not correspond to my own assumptions about medicine’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_2">1.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>).

What about a photograph of an idyllic mountain resort (figs. 4 & 7), a portrait of a doctor taken for a conference (figs. 8 & 9), or a graphic of a flapper dancing with death (fig. 10) have to do with the ways doctors saw and treated their patients?

This chapter addresses this surprising observation with a series of questions: what are some of the broader assumptions which encircle the treatment of tuberculosis? How are these reproduced in visual media? How do they display differing visual practices in the history of medicine (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_2">1.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>)? And in what ways do these images reinforce the classist, racist, and ableist <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

I ask these questions first because of the implicit connections between tuberculosis research and the other cultural actors producing images. Some of the visual material is closely related to scientific research, as with the cases of material in public-facing magazines published by sanatoria with research capabilities (<i>The Sanatorium</i> and the first few volumes of <i>The Journal of Outdoor Life</i>) (fig. 11). Other materials were linked to public health and volunteer organizations like the Anti-Tuberculosis Health League or the Charity Organization Society of the City of New York, and even more were public-facing books that were meant to help patients with tuberculosis find sanatoria, understand how to treat their loved ones, or provide knowledge regarding hygiene (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_4">1.3.4</a>). Beyond this, even more images came from self-published or regionally published materials that may or may not have any association with the scientific <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

This broad range of publications speaks also to a wide array of writers and readers. Where a visual practice---like the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

In this chapter I will wrangle the sometimes disparate threads which knot around the non-scientific representations of tuberculosis in this period. I pursue two arguments: first, in building on the excellent but narrow scholarship by my peers who analyze medicine and its ways of seeing, I stress a need to look at medicine’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual cultures</b></span> in the plural.

Future scholarship will help nuance, rebuke, or clarify the claims I make.[^fn18]

To foreground the broader cultures around tuberculosis, I am going to follow three case studies---on the sanatorium (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_1">1.2.1</a>), hygiene (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_1">1.3.1</a>), and the medical practitioner at work (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_4_1">1.4.1</a>)---to define some <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

In doing this, my hope is to articulate in clear detail the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Eugenics refers to a way of thinking that thinks that human society can bettered by selective reproduction.

Concepts of class, ability, cleanliness, and health appear in relation to the cultural conception of tuberculosis, as well as the popular and scientific understandings regarding treatment. As Linda Bryder has argued, tuberculosis doctors in the early twentieth century “showed themselves to be very much a product of the middle-class society from which they came, with its fixed assumptions about the poor.”[^fn19] This chapter extends this claim to think about how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

By examining the profusion of gazes which saw tuberculosis, patients with tuberculosis, the sanitarium, and the doctors themselves, this chapter expands and complicates medical vision beyond the clinical (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_2">1.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_2">2.1.2</a>).

[^fn3]: Having returned to Sontag’s essay after doing the main research for this dissertation, I do think that her work with tuberculosis eschews scientific knowledge and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

Sontag is overdependent on the popular representation of pulmonary tuberculosis and is either uninterested in the disease’s many different presentations (from Pott’s disease to meningeal tuberculosis) or is unaware of the varied conditions linked to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.

[^fn4]: The AIDS crisis also brought with it a cultural interest in tuberculosis with exceptional scholarship penned by Linda Bryder and Georgina Feldberg. Both of their books were written in the wake of this historical moment.

[^fn7]: A note on spelling: The institutions in the period of inquiry spelled sanatorium many different ways---often spelling the word sanitarium. I have chosen to standardize the spelling “sanatorium”, but will use other spellings when using proper names.
