Susan Sontag's *Illness as Metaphor* reflects on how sick subjects are viewed following a diagnosis with a disease. Written after her own experience with breast cancer, the essay reflects on how isolating and stigmatizing it was to go through chemotherapy treatment in the 1970s. She thought about the kinds of language that was used around cancer, and the ways the disease was represented in the contemporary <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourse</b></span>. Her essay was, also, a comparative one, using tuberculosis at the turn of the twentieth century as a foil. Tuberculosis was popularly conceived as a wasting disease, for Romantics ([1.2.1](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_1.html)), poets and artists who burnt out young, as they frenziedly lost weight until they were left bedridden and on death's door. She writes,

>TB sufferers may be represented as passionate but are, more characteristically, deficient in vitality, in life force. . . . TB is celebrated as the disease of born victims, of sensitive, passive people who are not quite life-loving enough to survive. . . . And while the standard representation of a death from TB places the emphasis on the perfected sublimation of feeling, the recurrent figure of the tubercular courtesan indicates that TB was also thought to make the sufferer sexy.[^fn1]

Sontag played with popular imaginations of tuberculosis not only to comparatively reflect on the alienation she felt as a cancer patient, but also to think about how the sick are thought at a cultural scale: the ideas about specific diseases manifest in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

In some ways the essay fits well next to the critiques of Phillipe Ariés, Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, and Cisely Saunders, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Death studies is an interdisciplinary field that gained traction in the late twentieth century.

Sontag's essay, as well as its follow-up essay on the metaphors around AIDS, critiques both the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Medicalization refers to how health concerns have migrated from non-scientific and non-medical spaces and practices into specifically biomedical spaces.

Tuberculosis is an excellent choice to use as a prop and contrast for Sontag's essay. Not a strawman by any means,[^fn3] but broad enough, and so present in the public consciousness, so that even after the advent of antibiotics most people are aware of its history and cultural impact. Tuberculosis always returns, not unlike its recurring infection in the body of a patient, by way of the AIDS crisis, the advancement of drug resistant TB, and global inequities in care.[^fn4] It remains in the public consciousness, both in the recollections of loved ones who have memories of family members with the disease,[^fn5] but also in the ways tuberculosis is leveraged as a exclusion agent ([1.3.5](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_5.html)). Many of my colleagues who traveled to the United States for school have told me about the mandatory screenings they had to take before they could be allowed in the country.[^fn6] The popular imagination of the disease resides as an afterimage, nestled into <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourses</b></span> of public health, care standards, popular media, and xenophobic debates around immigration. This luminescent remnant was produced as a result of broader cultural, scientific, and governmental forces, which focused around tuberculosis in the late nineteenth century. This was created in equal measure by a change in knowledge around the disease (2.2.0), by the popularization of the sanitorium treatment (1.2.0), by the adoption of germ theory (2.2.0), by the emergence of public health approaches to medicine (1.3.0), and by an active volunteer network fighting to rid the nation of tuberculosis.

This popular and social understanding was informed by, and in turn influenced, the scientific imagination of the disease. I use this term scientific imagination to stress the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>social construction</b></span> of health (x.x.x),[^fn7] and to note the cultural influence of the disease prior to Robert Koch's bacteriological studies (2.2.0), when it had been considered a hereditary, wasting disease.[^fn8] For the majority of the nineteenth century, tuberculosis was associated with those with an artistic disposition---the Romantic poet John Keats being the most cited example.[^fn9] Those with the disease were thought to burn bright and fast and be *consumed* over months or years. These conceptions of heredity, as well as ideas regarding a set limit of energy a human had in their lifespan, persisted into the twentieth century, with familial disposition to the disease becoming a central conceit for germ versus soil arguments[^fn10]---where the embodied disposition of a patient was thought to be more important for a tuberculosis infection than *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* itself ([1.3.5](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_5.html)).[^fn11]

In this context, I would be remiss if I did not address the popular imagination in this dissertation. Tuberculosis looms large in the medical memory in part due to these cultural influences and in part due to its ebb and flow as a problem in global health.[^fn12] I also am conscious of my demands of the readers of this dissertation: while they may have lingering memories of the disease, there is a lot of historical and cultural context which an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use the term interdisciplinary (as opposed to multidisciplinary) in this dissertation to convey how different methodologies and frameworks guide my research."><b>interdisciplinary</b></span> audience may only be aware of in passing. 

Perhaps most important too is that in the development of the dataset for this dissertation (0.x.x; X.x.x), I found myself inundated with images that did not correspond to my assumptions about medicine's <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span> ([1.1.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_1_2.html)). I had assumed that the majority of images would correspond to the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a scientific framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> at different scales---cellular images, wet specimens, and full body pathological portraits---and in different media---illustrations, photographs, and x-rays. What I did not expect was that scientific journals also published about sanitaria, arguing about the merits of specific floor plans ([1.2.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_4.html)); promoting their facilities ([1.2.3](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_3.html)); gazing at poor, disabled, or otherwise othered patients ([1.3.1](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_1.html); [1.3.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_4.html); [1.3.5](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_5.html)). They were looking at and defining the broader cultures around tuberculosis beyond the remit of the specimen. 

This chapter, then, works to foreground the non-<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a scientific framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> images which litter the tuberculosis data set (x.x.x). What does a child selling postage seals (fig. 1), an architectural floorplan for a sanitorium (fig. 2), an image of a filthy room (fig. 3), images of children studying in heavy coats (fig. 4), and a photograph of a cottage (fig. 5) have to do with the scientific understandings of the disease? What about a photograph of an idyllic mountain resort (figs. 6 & 7), a portrait of a doctor taken for a conference (figs. 8 & 9), or a graphic of a flapper dancing with death (fig. 10) have to do with the ways doctors saw and treated their patients?

This chapter addresses this surprising observation with a series of questions: what are some of the broader assumptions which encircle the treatment of tuberculosis? How are these reproduced in visual media? How do they display differing visual practices in the history of medicine ([1.1.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_1_2.html); 2.1.2)? And in what ways do these images reinforce the classist, racist, and ableist ideologies in the health sciences ([1.3.5](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_5.html))?

I ask these questions first because of the implicit connections between tuberculosis research and the other cultural actors producing images. Some of the visual material is closely related to scientific research, as with the cases of material in public-facing magazines published by sanitaria with research capabilities (*The Sanatorium* and the first few volumes of *The Journal of Outdoor Life*) (fig. 11). Other materials were linked to public health and volunteer organizations like the Anti-Tuberculosis Health League or the Charity Organization Society of the City of New York, and even more were public-facing books that were meant to help tuberculous patients find sanitaria, understand how to treat their loved ones, or provide knowledge regarding hygiene ([1.3.4](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_3_4.html)). Beyond this, even more images came from self-published or regionally published materials that may or may not have any association with the scientific <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

This broad range of publications speaks also to a wide array of writers and readers. Where a visual practice---like the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease.

In this chapter I will wrangle the sometimes disparate threads which knot around the non-scientific representations of tuberculosis in this period. I pursue two arguments: first, in building on the excellent but narrow scholarship by my peers who analyze medicine and its ways of seeing, I stress a need to look at medicine's <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual cultures</b></span> in the plural. Medicine has never practiced a singular <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span>, one overtly defined by the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy, and this process alienates the patient, turning them into a collection of pathologies rather than a human person."><b>clinical gaze</b></span>. By opening this <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourse</b></span> to competing, overlapping, contested visual practices, I encourage future scholars to explore the idiosyncratic visual modes leveraged by medical doctors, patients, and others working in healthcare.[^fn16] Moreover, where this chapter addresses tuberculosis, I acknowledge that the cultural landscape which emerged around other diseases---like the AIDS epidemic, cancer research, the 1918 influenza epidemic, or Covid-19---is quite different than the one I describe in this chapter. The modes of seeing and being seen in these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourses</b></span> are probably quite different for these health crises, and they deserve equal attention. Future scholarship will help nuance, rebuke, and clarify the claims I make.[^fn17]

To foreground the broader cultures around tuberculosis, I am going to follow three case studies---on hygiene (1.3.0), the sanatorium (1.2.0), and the medical practitioner at work (1.4.0)---to define some <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

In doing this, my hope is to articulate in clear detail the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Eugenics refers to a way of thinking that thinks that human society can bettered by selective reproduction.

Concepts of class, ability, cleanliness, and health appear in relation to the cultural conception of tuberculosis, as well as the popular and scientific understandings regarding treatment. As Linda Bryder has argued, tuberculosis doctors in the early twentieth century "showed themselves to be very much a product of the middle-class society from which they came, with its fixed assumptions about the poor."[^fn18] This chapter extends this claim to think about how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourses</b></span> around the disease, made possible by medical professionals, patients, and the lay public, reinforced these structures. By examining the profusion of gazes which saw tuberculosis, tuberculous patients, the sanitarium, and the doctors themselves, this chapter expands and complicates medical vision beyond the clinical ([1.1.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_1_2.html); 2.1.2).

[^fn3]: Having returned to Sontag's essay after doing the main research for this dissertation, I do think that her work with tuberculosis eschews scientific knowledge and discourses around the disease, relying too heavily on arts-informed receptions of the condition. Sontag is overdependent on the popular representation of pulmonary tuberculosis and is either uninterested in the disease's many different presentations (from Pott's disease to meningeal tuberculosis) or is unaware of the varied conditions linked to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

[^fn4]: The AIDS crisis also brought with it a cultural interest in tuberculosis with exceptional scholarship penned by Linda Bryder and Georgina Feldberg written in the wake of this historical moment.

[^fn12]: The development of antibiotic and chemotherapy approaches to *Mycobaterium tuberculosis* in the mid-twentieth century made the disease almost non-existent in the western world; however, tuberculosis came back into the public consciousness because of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, as well as the emergence of antibiotic resistant TB.
	
	Many of the books that I quote regularly, like Linda Bryder's *Below the Magic Mountain* were written in this same period of reemergence.
	
	One of the reasons why I am interested in the disease is because of its strange parallels with Covid-19, and the global biomedical system's inability to address a disease that both had a long incubation period and was very contagious.
