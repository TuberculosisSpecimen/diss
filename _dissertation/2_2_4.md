This concept is borrowed from death studies, an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term interdisciplinary (as opposed to multidisciplinary) in this dissertation to convey how different methodologies and frameworks guide my research."><b>interdisciplinary</b></span> field that examines various human relationships with death. Scholars in this academic conversation have thought about how medical systems both frame and produce death for human <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program. I think of the subject in a Foucauldian sense: The 'subject' is a pun on the monarchal subject, someone who has no agency under the spectacular power of the sovereign. In this case it the subject lacks agency in relation to the researcher studying them."><b>subjects</b></span>. Some of the most formative scholarship in this field, like the work of Phillipe Ariés, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, and Cicely Saunders, has criticized the medicalization of death.[^fn2] Central in these scholars’ critique is that the institutionalization of death by medical actors leads to both homogenized experiences of death---which undermines the value and ritual of death in certain cultures and contexts---as well as the alienation of patients in hospitals.[^fn3] Ariés, the historian of this group of scholars, argues that in the twentieth century medically-mediated deaths became the dominant mode by which western individuals experienced the end of their lives, which overshadowed other cultural understandings concerning death.[^fn4] 

There are two limitations to the way death studies has engaged with the medicalization of death. First, is that by critiquing this practice, there is less emphasis on how and why <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

A <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

In this case it the subject lacks agency in relation to the researcher studying them."><b>subject</b></span> who is dying of lung cancer in hospice may experience a good death,[^fn5] but their death may have been impacted by broader industrial malfeasance regarding air pollution and tobacco use. There is a continuity between the social, political, and structural forces outside of the hospital which need attention. Second, the emphasis on human death and its experience circumvents the more prominent role death factors into the creation of culture at large (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_4">2.1.4</a>).[^fn6] Death is an inescapable interlocutor in the maintenance of life, and in the context of modern, western culture, death proliferates for humans and non-humans alike at a global scale.[^fn7]  Death culture cannot and should not be isolated to the medical or human contexts. As I have written elsewhere, “What is key here is <i>who</i> and <i>what</i> dies, <i>for whom</i> and <i>for what</i> purpose do they die and <i>who</i> and <i>what</i> survives.”[^fn8] 

I adopt this turn to critique a form of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>necropolitics</b></span> articulated by death scholar John Troyer. While other parts of Troyer’s scholarship are exceptional, his redefinition of Achille Mbembe’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>necropolitics</b></span> circumvents and ignores the Cameroonian postcolonialist thinker’s highly influential use of the term. Troyer writes, in a footnote, that Mbembe’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>necropolitics</b></span> is defined “as a politics of death. Necropolitics is more accurately, I argue, a political field that involves not the act of death itself but instead the already dead.”[^fn9] By making a semantic argument, Troyer neglects to engage with Mbembe’s definition of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>necropolitics</b></span>---the structural ways the death of unwanted populations is built into a society, and the technologies that produce death at higher rates for those same populations.[^fn10] 

Mbembe’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>necropolitics</b></span> is an extremely helpful framework to discuss inequities in health especially, as it is a way to explain the huge losses of life by gay men in the AIDS epidemic or the current problem regarding the Black maternal death rate. While I chastise Troyer for undermining a prominent postcolonial theorist, I must also admit that there are aspects of his work that have been helpful in my thinking. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>Necropolitics</b></span>, as it is formulated by Troyer, reinvents the term with particular care to the technology and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Social construction refers to a philosophical approach to ontology and epistemics, where human understandings of phenomena are dependent on a social agreement regarding how that phenomenon is interpreted."><b>social construction</b></span> of the corpse. This term builds upon Troyer's formulation of the ‘postmortem subject’---a socio-historical actor that is the result of a confluence of scientific and cultural developments during the mid-nineteenth century, which specifically transform the corpse into a kind of technologized and commodifiable thing.[^fn11] <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>Necropolitics</b></span>, out of this way of thinking, is an extension of the capitalized technology of embalming and its connection to the funerary industry that affords an engagement with politics of the corpse in a broader sense.

Revising and building upon this conceptual ground, Troyer leverages a distinction made from the greek root <i>nekros</i> to emphasize that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>necropolitics</b></span> is a politics of the already dead, describing the technological-cultural apparatuses of care, maintenance and control over the human corpse. Building from Georgio Agemben’s engagement with the concentration camp,[^fn12] the control over the corpse becomes political in the ways it hides the production of death. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>Necropolitics</b></span> in this context is a means to covertly explain away those death making processes: “when the authorities overseeing a camp decide that a dead body is not a living body made dead by the authorities in change, rather a dead body produced by an always-possible ‘natural death,’ then no wrongful act ever occurred.”[^fn13]

My interest in both of these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Necropolitics refers to the implicit and structural means by which certain political actors are made to die."><b>necropolitics</b></span> is in how they engage with the dead at different levels and moments, and that they see death and the corpse as being produced by specific cultural actors for specific <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

In order for a doctor to remove a tuberculous lung from a dead patient---in order to extract, cut it, submerge it in alcohol, and make it visible for scientific argument (fig. 1 & 2) (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_3_1">2.3.1</a>)---the patient had to first die, and the production of that death is interlinked with structural imbalances which produce death for unwanted actors in a given culture.
