The previous two case studies (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_1">1.2.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_3_1">1.3.1</a>) have looked at tuberculosis and its influence on culture at different scales, with a focus on architecture and hygiene. What is absent from both of these case studies is the figure of medical professionals---especially white male doctors---even in contexts where the inclusions of these doctors and nurses in the frame might be beneficial.

One of the important aspects when it comes to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy. This process alienates the patient, turning them into a collection of pathologies rather than a human person."><b>clinical vision</b></span> is its unidirectional nature: doctors look at their patients, defining symptoms and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathologies</b></span>, but the gaze is never returned.[^fn1] There is power in being behind the camera, being the person who illustrates a body or organ, being the radiologist and not the one whose body is photographed, illustrated, or x-rayed. Medical professionals seem adept, consciously or otherwise, at not being captured in the visual rhetoric of their arguments. Their gaze looks outward, and even when medical personnel are in line of sight of the camera, usually it is nurses whose bodies and faces are displayed in these images (figs. 1 & 2). The power of absence---to see and not be seen---positions doctors especially as impervious to the criticism levied at their patients.[^fn2]

It is hard to find doctors in the tuberculosis <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="A corpus refers to a collection of texts used for computational analysis."><b>corpus</b></span> and image dataset (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_1_1">X.1.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_1_3">X.1.3</a>). They appear in two prominent contexts: the first is in the professional headshot. When these images are used in an argument, and not in the frontmatter of a book or as part of an obituary, those moments are often reserved for the most prominent and influential scientists, with Robert Koch (figs. 3 & 13) and E. L. Trudeau (fig. 4) being the most common figures.

The other context in which doctors appear is in more candid shots, where they are shown treating patients or doing laboratory work. These photographs are not as common as many of the other images, and these depictions tend to appear in promotional contexts or in publications that describe daily operations of a hospital or sanatorium. There is also a notable difference in their *mise en scene*, with doctors treating patients in more sparse exam rooms or hospital rooms (figs. 5 - 7), or with doctors being caught in semi-candid or posed stances in laboratory rooms or pharmacy/dispensary rooms (figs. 8 & 9).

The professional image of medical scientists is instead bound to these clinical spaces, with the accoutrements of the most advanced, scientific practices surrounding them. Often doctors are posed around their equipment (fig. 10 & 12); other times, there are human remains in frame (fig. 11). These images are coded with the technical iconography of modern science---pharmaceuticals, microscopes.[^fn3] Often the doctor is framed in a candid, unassuming way, often doing some kind of beneficial work---caring for children, attending to a patient, doing surgery. The context here is important, because the images seem more associated with *facilities and the institution* and not people, not even the doctors themselves.

</div>

A model of this practice can be seen in the ways Robert Koch was framed in the tuberculosis <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are taken for granted in a community or scholarly field."><b>discourse</b></span>. The German bacteriologist had been the subject of a prominent profile in *Harper’s Weekly*,[^fn4] and the images made for that profile were commonly reproduced: both his portrait (fig. 13) and the drawing of the scientist in his lab appeared multiple times in my research (fig 14). Koch’s framing includes a detail to another space in the lab, presumably cabinets with equipment, that are associated with his authority as a man of science. In all of these images the figure of the doctor is dwarfed by the tools of the medical trade, or by a clean, exquisitely furnished laboratory space. These images convey what was a cutting-edge approach to tuberculosis, something which sanatoria would use in their promotional materials (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_2_2">1.2.2</a>). It also conveys a kind of labor that is separate from but intrinsic to the act of curing; these spaces, so advanced in their processes, were also distinctly separate from the patient’s bodies. 

The images of patients seem almost staged (figs. 6, 8, & 10). I address this to think about how the careful framing, and the detail in exposure, would imply a kind of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the phrase 'consent' to refer to the idea of informed consent: that a research subject needs to be aware of what will happen to them in a research project, and that they have the ability to say 'no' at any point during the research program."><b>consent</b></span>, at least from the doctor. Inviting a photographer into the space, having them set up their equipment, and posing for the image all require a kind of acceptance that this work will be done. These are not doctors caught in the act unaware. Very rarely do they return their gaze to the camera (fig. 15). The authority of medical scientists in these spaces make these images most likely <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the phrase 'consent' to refer to the idea of informed consent: that a research subject needs to be aware of what will happen to them in a research project, and that they have the ability to say 'no' at any point during the research program."><b>consensual</b></span>, at least for the professionals caught in frame.

Doctors may not expose the film in the camera, but they can say whether they should be photographed in the first place.
