The previous two sections (1.2.0; 1.3.0) have looked at tuberculosis and its influence on culture at different scales, with a focus on architecture and hygiene. What is absent from both of these case studies is the figure of medical professionals, even in contexts where the inclusions of doctors and nurses in the frame might be beneficial. Why might this be?

One of the important aspects when it comes to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="The clinical gaze refers to an ocular practice used by medical professionals to diagnose disease. It relies on a process of seeing the patient in relation to an idealized image of human anatomy, and this process alienates the patient, turning them into a collection of pathologies rather than a human person."><b>clinical vision</b></span> is its unidirectional nature: doctors look at their patients, define symptoms and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathologies</b></span>, but the gaze is never returned.[^fn1] There is certainly a power in being behind the camera, being the person who illustrates a body or organ, being the radiologist and not the one underneath the x-ray. Medical professionals seem adept, consciously or otherwise, at not being captured in the visual rhetoric of their arguments. Their gazes looks outward, and even when medical personel are in line of sight of the camera, usually it is nurses whose bodies and faces are displayed in these images (figs. 1 & 2). There is a certain power in being able to be absent from the image---to see and not be seen.[^fn2]

Saunders Company, 1910.

It is hard to find doctors in the tuberculosis corpus (X.1.1) and image dataset (X.1.2). They appear in two prominent contexts: the first is in the professional headshot. When they are used in an argument, and not in the frontmatter of a book or as part of an obituary, they often reserved for the most prominent and influential scientists: Robert Koch (figs. 3 & 13) and E. L. Trudeau (fig. 4) being the most common figures.

**Figure 3.** Robert Koch's portrait is the most popularly reproduced one in the literature of the period, with many different photographs and illustrations appearing in the text. Knopf, S.

The other context doctors appear is in more candid shots treating patients or doing laboratory work. These photographs are not as common as many of the other images, and tend to appear in promotional contexts or in publications that describe daily operations of a hospital or sanitarium. There is also a notable difference in their *mise en scene*, with doctors treating patients in more sparse exam rooms or hospital rooms (figs. 5 - 7), or with doctors being caught in semi-candid or posed stances in laboratory rooms or pharmacy/dispensary rooms (figs. 8 & 9).

**Figure 9.** The laboratory space is important for these images, as it signifies an advanced or sophisticated approach to the disease. They also probably required space and materials that would have been hard to allocate in even the most well funded institution.The Illinois State Board of Health. *The Early Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis*. Illinois State Board of Health, 1905.

The professional image of medical scientists is bound to these spaces, with the accouterments of the most advanced, scientific practices surrounding them. Often doctors are posed around their equipment (fig. 10 & 12); other times, there are human remains in frame (fig. 11). There is a tenor to these images which are coded with the iconography of modern science---pharmaceuticals, microscopes.[^fn3] Often the doctor is framed in a candid, unassuming way, often doing some kind of beneficial work---caring for children, attending to a patient, doing surgery. The context here is important, because the images seem more associated with *facilities and the institution* and not people, not even the doctors themselves.

A model of this practice can be seen in the ways Robert Koch was framed in the tuberculosis <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production. I use it in a Foucauldian sense, to convey the agreed upon modes and objects of discussion which are commonly discussed in a scholarly discipline"><b>discourse</b></span>. The German bacteriologist had been the subject of a prominent profile in *Harper's Weekly*,[^fn4] and the images made for that profile were commonly reproduced: both his portrait (fig. 13) and the drawing of the scientist in his lab appeared multiple times in my research (fig 14). Koch's framing includes a detail to another space in the lab, presumably cabinets with equipment, that are associated with his authority as a man of science. In all of these images the figure of the doctor is dwarfed by the tools of their trade, or the clean, exquisitely furnished laboratory space. These images convey what was a cutting edge approach to the disease, something which sanataria would use in their promotional materials ([1.2.2](https://tuberculosisspecimen.github.io/diss/dissertation/1_2_2.html)). It also conveys a kind of labor that is separate from, but intrinsic to the act of curing; these spaces, so advanced in their processes, were also distinctly separate from the patient's bodies.

With images of patients, I want to point to how they too appear staged (figs. 6, 8, & 10). I address this to think about how the careful framing, and the detail in exposure, would imply a kind of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use consent in relation to the idea of informed consent: that a patient would be first cognizant of the what is done to them, for them, or through them, and that they would have the ability to say 'no' at any point during research."><b>consent</b></span>, at least from the doctor. Inviting a photographer into the space, having them set up their equipment, and posing for the image all require a kind of acceptance that this work will be done. These are not doctors caught in the act unaware. Very rarely do they return the glace to the camera (fig. 15). The authority of medical scientists in these spaces make these images most likely <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="I use consent in relation to the idea of informed consent: that a patient would be first cognizant of the what is done to them, for them, or through them, and that they would have the ability to say 'no' at any point during research."><b>consensual</b></span>, at least for the professionals caught in frame.

**Figure 15.** This image is striking because of the way the doctor glances at the camera. Are they returning the gaze in the form of a refusal? Are they posing as a kind of authority? Crowell, F. Elisabeth. *The Work of New York's Tuberculosis Clinics*. 1910. Image courtesy of the New York Academy of Medicine.

For the patients though, even those that were caught in a more posed exposure, consent is more fraught. To think this through, I want to look at a photograph where a doctor and a patient were photographed together (fig. 16). The doctor, whose face is visible, and who is working in a professional manner probably consented to the photographer taking the picture. I am less convinced that the subject, whose back is turned away in this photograph had the same ability to consent. The image of the doctor at work, whether doing treatments, research, or other aspects of their jobs (figs. 17 - 19), depends on the figure of a patient whose consent is forced or coerced. Moreover, as consent can be taken through the coercive or punitive force,[^fn5] the power dynamic between patient and doctor makes any presumable agreement and acceptance of the photographic act almost impossible. I stress consent because it is an important concept in this dissertation, which I will address in the fourth chapter (4.1.2; 4.1.4), and because it stresses a power differential between <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" title="Subject refers to a single human actor who has been made into a researchable object within a knowledge system."><b>subject</b></span> and researcher (2.1.4). Moreover, consent, codified as it was in the post-war period, was a concept that was not dominant in medical practice: doctors did not regularly tell patients what their illness was upon diagnosis, and did not always tell patients that they were part of an experimental study.[^fn6] For doctors to be able to say 'no' at any point in an imaging process implies some agency over the image itself: doctors may not expose the film in the camera, but they can say whether they should be photographed in the first place.

There is a consciousness about the operation of these images: they are documents, specimens, things that convey a message to the public. And the absence of medical staff throughout the corpus speaks to a reticence to being shown in these contexts. This implicit sense of how and in what context an image operates is not conveyed to the humans who were posed in these contexts without their consent. 

As I finish this chapter, I will look at this strange omission in the materials, and try to glimpse the medical professionals in the moments where their presence is less obvious, but equally manufactured. I will look at the doctors when they hold their patients in place, when their hands display not just a professional touch, but also a disciplining one: one to hold the patient still for the camera, to hold the patient in place for a procedure.

[^fn1]: This is not entirely true, at least in the case of photography, because some patients had agency in how they were photographed in some contexts. It is more true in the context of everyday medical diagnosis: which is not recorded, and which the clinical gaze sees through the patient.
