There is a logical fallacy which <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathology</b></span> perpetuates: that the unique phenomena embodied in a patient which is used in a case study can be isolated and generalized. The processes of isolation, extraction, and distillation are dependent on a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

In making my argument for this chapter, I have rallied <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

Doing this I find myself needing to link my own project to this same conceptual fallacy: I too have distilled, isolated, and simplified these <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin.

Much of my argument depends on a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="New materialism is an approach that examines how non-human agents--animals, plants, non-living objects--exert and influence the diegetic world."><b>new materialist</b></span> presumption that the technologies which surround representational practices have their own non-human agencies, histories, and interdependencies (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_4">2.1.4</a>).

Material broadly refers to the complex lives of nonhuman-- things and their interactions in the world."><b>material</b></span> exigencies are the very stuff from which scientists make their claims. To use a simple diagram, I have argued a causal link between disease progression as a patient history (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>), the extraction of an organ at autopsy (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_3_1">2.3.1</a>) and the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

I can represent it as a sequential process: a timeline (table 1).

<div class="caption-font"> style="font-size:.9em">**Table 1.** This is a timeline of the normal process of creating a biomedical specimen.</div>

I could conceive this as a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Life histories refer to the ways objects' change over time, based on cultural understandings and age.

In <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="New materialism is an approach that examines how non-human agents--animals, plants, non-living objects--exert and influence the diegetic world."><b>new materialism</b></span> the turn away from human-centric models was met, in part, by an evacuation of anthropocentrism in humanistic knowledge production: there are entire universes which humans may touch but do not deterministically control.[^fn3]

The ecologically minded, posthumanist shift of thinkers like Bruno Latour, Graham Harmon, Jane Bennet, and Karen Barad have helped me move away from thinking about representation as being something for humans and between humans.[^fn4] They have pushed me to think of all of the nuances, traces, and contacts between multiple non-human actors, as well as between humans and the non-human world. At the same time, the limitations of these approaches are obvious for the current project, as this dissertation is interested in the impact of human practices on human lives and human bodies. But there is a second larger problem: <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="New materialism is an approach that examines how non-human agents--animals, plants, non-living objects--exert and influence the diegetic world."><b>new materialism</b></span> tends to circumvent the human, cultural problems which undergird and oppress many actors within human cultures. Lane Nooney summarizes this problem: 

>[w]hile many of the most provocative and innovative materialist media theories attempt to productively short circuit the subject-object division by displaying how media are active agents in the world, these efforts often wind up simply rearranging actor-network deck chairs, envisioning histories and theories without corporeal or discursive bodies.[^fn5]

<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="New materialism is an approach that examines how non-human agents--animals, plants, non-living objects--exert and influence the diegetic world."><b>New materialist</b></span> ideas are provocative, but they seem best at opening new terrains for future research, affording new extractive possibilities for humanists, while often ignoring the very human needs of othered <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

Importantly, for this dissertation and for this chapter, frameworks like object-oriented ontology (OOO) and actor network theory (ANT) share an ethical problem: they evacuate the human and in doing so evacuate the responsibility researchers have to their research interlocutors, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

They create a new isolated environment to perform new forms of research (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_4_2">2.4.2</a>). 

Returning to the timeline above, I can break it down hierarchically and temporally to think about the complexity between humans and nonhumans in that basic timeline (table 2). A <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Pathology refers to the study of aberrant phenomenon in the human body and how it is linked to human illness."><b>pathological</b></span> <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> depends on both the human subject and their history as well as on the agency of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*; it depends on the technologies of scalpels, and glassmaking, and spirit production (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>); it depends on aesthetic categories defined within the biomedical discourse (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_1_3">2.1.3</a>); it depends on processes of preservation and distribution. Attending to parts of this larger network of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

I can talk about the creation of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span>.
