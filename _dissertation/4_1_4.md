While Édouard Glissant’s notion of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> is a productive counter-ethic developed within the postcolonial tradition, it is worth mentioning that <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> is often practiced as a means to protect knowledge workers from critique. In fact, as Harriet Washington has shown, the history of medical argument is so entwined with an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span> inscrutability so as to hide its malfeasance in plain sight:

>As previously hidden experimental exploits come to light, some have challenged the characterization of such research as ’secret,’ noting that the reports were published in medical and scientific journals that could be read by anyone. But these critics would do well to weight Marcel Pagnol’s definition of secrecy: “A secret is not something unrevealed, but told privately in a whisper.” Until the past few decades, descriptions in medical publications of experimentation with African Americans were shielded from the eyes of the uninitiated. Generalized professional journals such as the *Journal of the American Medical Association* and *The New England Journal of Medicine* are not available in bookstores or on newsstands. . . . Moreover, physical access to such journals would constitute only the first hurdle. The medical jargon in which such research papers are couched is often impenetrable even to well-educated nonmedical people.[^fn1]

Washington’s discussion of hidden-in-plain-sight medical <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discourse refers to a scholarly conversation which occurs in a field of knowledge production.

Medical research is replete with obscuring practices---the anonymity of whose bodies were brought under the knife. The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opacity</b></span> of published medical argument is often at odds with the visibility, the transparency, of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>.

As Chip Colwel argues, using the testimony of Apache naturalist Ramon Riley to the NAGPRA Review Committee, 

>NAGPRA requires Native American religious leaders to expose themselves in order to get back what they believe is rightly theirs. The act of revealing---[Ramon Riley’s] own culture and personal experience---was kind of sacrilege, yet it was required by the legal process. Riley was manipulating the highly public venue of a NAGPRA Review Committee meeting---open to the public, a process of becoming part of the public record---to emphasize his very objection to how NAGPRA obliges such a public revealing. In contrast, the museum involved in the dispute did not provoke any information (secret or otherwise); it did not even send any representative to the public hearing.[^fn4]

The implicit problem is that the creation of more knowledge may not be the answer to this ethical dilemma in medicine, even if that knowledge is produced with reparative intent, because it still always depends on the researcher’s original sin: extracting material from a <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term research subject refers to a human person who has been ingested into a research program, and whose identity, personhood, and body have become the focus of a research program.

Ease of access is not and cannot be only associated with technological affordances, but also with how many people can read, engage, and reflect on knowledge work (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_2">4.2.2</a>). With this in mind, I will spend the next section negotiating and arguing for how the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span> can inform digital scholarship.

	Two notes here: First, Washington does not cite the quote by Pagnol, so it is my assumption that this is a relatively well known phrase. Second, the elipsis in the quotation skips over a large chunk of the paragraph from which this quote is drawn. The parts of the argument that I skipped point to additional evidentiary claims, rather than changing aspects of her overall argument.
