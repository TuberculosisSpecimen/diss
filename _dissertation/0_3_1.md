This dissertation is composed of four chapters, broken into couplets based on subject matter. The first two chapters interrogate the history of tuberculosis, the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual cultures</b></span> around the disease after Robert Koch’s microbial arguments, and the use of specimens in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Normal science describes the process of doing research after a new paradigm has been developed in a knowledge field.

This dissertation is primarily a methods project: I am most interested in thinking through the problems of existing media studies approaches and trying to provide different methods and frameworks for future scholarship. This said, I wanted to include some more concrete case studies to help work through the concept of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> and how it is employed in medical knowledge work.

I have constructed the dissertation as a pair of couplets: the first couplet---chapters one and two---show the results of the methodologies for which I argue. They also, importantly, are presented in such a way as to show their limitations. This project is interested in the ethical problems that arise when working in the history of medicine, and rather than shying away or hiding my own messy, unethical work I have chosen to instead show it directly. I often write in this dissertation that I am a hypocrite, and that my arguments are fraught, imperfect, and messy (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_4_3">2.4.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_4_1">3.4.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_4_2">3.4.2</a>). This is a {#D-508}tactical</b></span> decision, because I want to show how even conscientious work is often at odds because of how it has to address problems at different scales (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_3_5">4.3.5</a>).[^fn2] I also wanted to have some evidence in the form of case studies for readers to be able to reflect on when reading the second couplet---chapters three and four---so that they may be able to see the ethical limitations of the first chapter couplet’s case studies. I have ordered these chapters as such, so as to emphasize that there could be no ethical interventions without having first gotten my hands dirty in the history of tuberculosis.

Chapters one and two address tuberculosis’ <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span>.

Chapter one looks to the non-scientific ways tuberculosis, patients with tuberculosis, and sanatoria were seen at the turn of the twentieth century. This chapter serves to set the table for the historical and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

Looking at three case studies---of the sanatoria movement, hygienic approaches to the disease, and the framing of medical professionals---it teases out the capitalistic, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Eugenics refers to a way of thinking that thinks that human society can bettered by selective reproduction.

I think about the wider <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual cultures</b></span> around tuberculosis which are not addressed by Michel Foucault’s {#D-507}clinical gaze</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_2">1.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>).[^fn4] The concepts around tuberculosis and those who suffered from the disease were defined by a broader network of volunteers, public health officials, and, of course, doctors. These were also developing alongside a growing <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

I show how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Biomedicine is an approach to health that uses scientific approaches to evidence-based medicine, with an emphasis on generalized treatments with surgical and pharmaceutical methods.

Chapter two builds upon this work to examine the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> in detail. Built around two case studies, I look at Robert Koch’s bacteriological research to concretize my thinking around the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span>, before addressing human <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid.

Following this examination, I turn to <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Wet specimens refer to living tissues preserved in fluid. Contemporary wet specimens are usually submerged in a formalin mixture, and older specimens from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were usually preserved in a spirit like rum or whiskey."><b>wet specimens</b></span>, as they appear in the tuberculosis <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="A corpus refers to a collection of texts used for computational analysis."><b>corpus</b></span>. This case study thinks through a patient's clinical history. This examination lets me ask about how <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span> become anonymous and in what ways a patient’s medical history is significant for medical knowledge work. I think through how the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="I use the term research object to refer to materials that have been divorced from the subject of their origin. Object, as I use it, carefully considers how human patients are denied their humanity through transformations that deem them as objects."><b>object</b></span> of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimen</b></span> requires a certain ahistoricity, while also demanding a specific detailed past for it to be leveraged for scientific claims. By examining this fraught linkage, with the help of Indigenous, <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="New materialism is an approach that examines how non-human agents--animals, plants, non-living objects--exert and influence the diegetic world."><b>new materialist</b></span>, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Death studies is an interdisciplinary field that thinks about how death informs and is informed by cultural practices.

Contemporary wet specimens are usually submerged in a formalin mixture, and older specimens from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were usually preserved in a spirit like rum or whiskey."><b>wet tissue specimen</b></span> which was taken from their body.

This second case study works to bridge my main intervention: <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Specimen refers to any naturally occurring phenomenon that has been extracted from its original context and placed within a knowledge framework to understand and describe that phenomenon."><b>specimens</b></span> were always people once, and as scholars we are obligated to care, respect, and tend to them. The next two chapters trace my thinking to get to these conclusions, by looking at two different analytical and practical methods.

Chapter three frames <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method. This can include traditional arts like painting, sculpture, or dance, or more complex conceptual or multi-media approaches."><b>arts-based research</b></span> as an exploratory and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term speculative refers to a broader discussion in history in how to best address structural violence which produces gaps in the archive.

Looking at two video installations and a photo essay, this chapter traces my thinking in each phase of the dissertation’s research, showing both a narrowing of subject matter and a slowly developing approach to the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span> (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/5_1_4">5.1.4</a>). In showing my work---taken from grant proposals, written documents accompanying the installations, and the installations themselves---I describe how the ethical problems in the history of medicine became so central in this dissertation, showing different, evolving approaches to how to display, describe, and engage with medicine’s often horrific primary materials. In working through these cases, I describe how creative approaches can be especially useful in early stages of scholarly research. Moreover, I think about the affordances of creative methods in ways that do not think of them as being essentially better than other analytical or scholarly approaches.

Chapter four follows chapter’s three’s interest in <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method.

Where the third chapter presents research <i>en media res</i>---or as it happened in the process of doing research---the fourth chapter shows the final results of these methodological and ethical concerns, presenting a framework which thinks through the slippery, violent problems of working in the history of medicine. This chapter shows how the critical digital humanities---a field that uses digital methods as an avenue to critique<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea.

This chapter engages with the ways <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Ideology refers to a generally agreed upon understanding of a phenomenon or cultural idea. Ideologies are like the air we breathe, in that they are pervasive and difficult to see without some framework to understand them."><b>refusal</b></span> can be used as a method to address the broader ethical problem of continued extraction and exploitation by medical scientists, historians of medicine, and myself (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/0_2_2">0.2.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_3">4.2.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_2_4">4.2.4</a>). More than theorizing on this problem, the chapter presents how an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Opacity is a rights-based philosophical framework that assumes humans have a right to not be known in knowledge systems."><b>opaque</b></span> ethics can be applied to future scholarship (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/4_3_5">4.3.5</a>).

The last two chapters in this dissertation reveal how an <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Iterative, here, refers to a process of learning in which completed projects are analyzed after their completion. This analysis allows for future projects to be more successful, and to address new, but related concepts."><b>iterative</b></span> research method can function in humanistic research. These two chapters reflect on the various methods and approaches I took during my research. Where the first two chapters show what kind of research I was able to enact over the course of the dissertation, the latter two show how much my thinking shifted the longer I worked with materials in the history of medicine. The various methods I applied, from the creation of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="A corpus refers to a collection of texts used for computational analysis."><b>corpus</b></span> and visual data set (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_1_1">X.1.1</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/X_1_3">X.1.3</a>), to exploration through arts-based research, to the literal application of the <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Anti-essentialism refers to a philosophical position that refutes singular causes for phenomena. It is often used to disrupt biological determinism in medical contexts and arguments."><b>opaque</b></span>, changed my understanding of tuberculosis, the doctors who worked on the disease, and the systems that produced scientific research. Each chapter should be seen as a permutation, which evolves over the course of the dissertation.	As everyone who has written a long document such as this is already aware of, every chapter and every section touches on and is influenced by every other. While there is an intentional structure at play, I encourage readers to follow the interlinking hyperlinks as they wish. Sometimes, as with the chapters on <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Visual culture refers to an interdisciplinary field that looks at the social construction of vision."><b>visual culture</b></span>, I will have touched on a concept multiple times (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/1_1_2">1.1.2</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/2_2_2">2.2.2</a>). Other times, I will mention a concept off-hand, providing the section in which I described this concept in more detail. In providing the links, my hope is to guide readers to different places in the dissertation that may help make the concept clearer, or give additional context as to my argument. This dissertation can be read in sequence or explored non-linearly. A linear approach shows a succession of logic which is built for readers who are more comfortable with book-style projects; the non-linear, by contrast, affords for readers a means to follow the arguments that speak most to them.
