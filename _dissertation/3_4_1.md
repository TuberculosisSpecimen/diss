What good are the arts, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method.

Should a chapter on method be focused on improving our methods, thus improving the final arguments produced with those approaches?

In my past framing of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method. This can include traditional arts like painting, sculpture, or dance, or more complex conceptual or multi-media approaches."><b>arts-based research</b></span> I saw it in the context of Michel de Certeau’s <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term tactics comes from the philosophy of Michel de Certeau, and refers to political action taken that has no impact on broader cultural and political struggles."><b>tactics</b></span>---which describes political action that does not produce meaningful, structural change (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_2_3">3.2.3</a>).[^fn1] By couching these methods in this term, I was negotiating a view which saw the labor of the arts in ways that were ultimately inconsequential, but not necessarily futile. The arts, and the creative, aesthetic, and <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Iterative, here, refers to a process of learning in which completed projects are analyzed after their completion. This analysis allows for future projects to be more successful, and to address new, but related concepts."><b>iterative</b></span> processes which generally accompany artistic practices, provide these circuitous, difficult to define possibilities for intervention, which can be folded into various <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense.

In turning *Terminal Imaginaries* into “Dermographic Opacities”, I was given an opportunity to parse through the nagging problems which surrounded my approach to reproducing medical images (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_3">3.3.3</a>; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dissertation/3_3_4">3.3.4</a>). The art project helped make a specific intervention in the history of medicine, and this dissertation is another permutation, transformation, and examination of those same problems. The notion of <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term tactics comes from the philosophy of Michel de Certeau, and refers to political action taken that has no impact on broader cultural and political struggles."><b>tactics</b></span> enables me to be more honest with the output: that *Terminal Imaginaries*, *Tuberculous Imaginaries*, and “Dermographic Opacities” were more useful as reflective exercises than they were in instilling any meaningful political change.

But this engagement across <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Discipline is used here in the Foucauldian sense. It is a pun that links forced discipline with the idea of a discipline of knowledge.

Serres argues that supposedly oppositional relationships are established through the perspective of one actor. What Serres sees are chains of dependence, consumption, and friction. Relationality[^fn4] from this frame establishes actors, not as concrete units but as constructed ideas based on whom and what they depend: “The Devil or the Good Lord? Exclusion, inclusion? Thesis or antithesis? The answer is a spectrum, a band, a continuum.”.[^fn5] A farmer, a city mouse, a country mouse,[^fn6] are all viewable as <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="The term 'parasite' comes from the tripartite ontology argued for by Michel Serres.

Rather than apply <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method. This can include traditional arts like painting, sculpture, or dance, or more complex conceptual or multi-media approaches."><b>arts-based research</b></span> as a method, I instead want to think of it as a *tactical heuristic*. ‘Heuristic’ refers to a flexible set of rules which guide decision making. It helps me see my own <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Arts-based methods refer to any research method that applies creative activity as a research method.

This dissertation, for example, is built on a skepticism toward the primary evidence in the history of medicine: not a skepticism toward its provenance or reality, but toward its various <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover="false" tabindex="1" data-title="Epistemics is a philosophical term referring to the study of knowledge.

Finally, if there is any value to this method it is in the same critical thread espoused by Tara McPherson regarding the digital humanities:

>In extending our critical methodologies, we must have at least a passing familiarity with code languages, operating systems, algorithmic thinking, and systems design. We need database literacies, algorithmic literacies, computational literacies, interface literacies. We need new hybrid practitioners: artist-theorists, programming humanists, activist-scholars; theoretical activists, critical race coders. . . . We have to shake ourselves out of our small, field-based boxes so that we might take seriously the possibility that our own knowledge practices are normalized, modular, and black boxed in much the same way as the code we study in our work.[^fn10]

Interdisciplinarity, while used as a buzzword for progressivist notions of scholarship, is regularly at odds with academia’s institutional structures (5.1.5).
