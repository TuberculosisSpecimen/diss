How did the Henry Phipps Institute come into the ownership of such a large collection of human brains? The arguments I have made in the previous two sections (0.3.2; 0.3.3) help me tease out how these objects are taken, and how Modern medical epistemics depend on this process of acquisition. But what are the results of these practices? Who (if anyone) is affected?

Charity hospitals have long had a history of taking advantage of desperate and poor subjects so that doctors may learn from those subject’s bodies. The Henry Phipps Institute also autopsied almost all of the subjects who died under their care. Doctors Rosenberger and White took care to break down, in detail, the various organs, their weights, and any pathologies of note (4.x.x [autopsy section]). In this same period, the Henry Phipps Institute’s medical museum (full of medical specimens) expanded rapidly. Institute director, Lawrence F. Flick wrote in the introduction to the second annual report that, “A building has also been rented on the outside near the Institute for a laboratory and an extension of the pathological museum.” Flick nonchalantly throws this out in a discussion of the institute’s growth, but it points to an implicit problem: they needed more space for the specimens which they acquired from posthumous examination. [add in numbers of autopsies] While they may not have been taking everyone’s brains who came to the institute’s autopsy table, many of their patients were disassembled after death.

One of the ethical problems that this dissertation engages with is a concern about the right and ability for people to designate their desires for their body after death. I draw on ideas expressed by two successive generations of death scholarship. The first group of scholars originated in western, English speaking cultures in the post-war period through the influential work of scholars like Cicely Saunders, Elisabeth Kübler Ross, and Phillipe Aires. Their arguments espoused an idealized vision of pre-modern death practices, and argued that the institutions in which subject died were alienating and dehumanizing. The mid-century crittique of this change, by psychologists, like Kübler Ross, historians like Aries, and medical professionals, like Cisely Saunders, was driven by a critique of how dehumanizing medicalization was for subjects. For Saunders, who was a leading figure in the hospice movement in the United Kingdom, palliative care meant an entirely different relationship for medicine: not toward cure, but toward care.

The nineteenth and twentieth century medicalization of death also saw a technologification of the corpse: John Troyer has argued that it was this very period when the funerary industry began codifying and popularizing modern embalming, a process that would blur the relationship between what constitutes the corpse. Embalming transforms the human corpse, in Troyer’s thinking, into a commodifiable, technologized object. His way of conceptualizing embalming, as a technology of the postmortem subject, links social needs to popular imagination and a rising funerary industry, and it is the image of the stable corpse---one which does not smell, or rot, and which bares an uncanny likeness in death as to who that corpse was in life---that forwards an idea of a cultural desire for wholeness in death. I will go into more detail concerning specific death practices later in chapter four (4.x.x), because I do not want to assume American deathways to be a universal.

The medicalization of death, and the social contruction of the postmortem subject intersect in medical research: subjects are valuable both in life and death to medical researchers. In death, the corpse may be preserved, made stable, through a bath in spirit, through a photograph, or through a detailed illustration. An extra thorn in Troyer’s idea, however, is that ti is never whole. It is always a piecce of the body, extracted and rendered in isolation against a neutral backdrop (figs. 4 4). The context of the subject’s dying gives rise to how they may be made useful within pre-Nurembergian medical ethics.

Many times, while writing this dissertation I have been asked ‘how would you like your body treated after you die?’ This question is usually asked when I explain my critique of postmortem exploitation, and while it is not malicious, it misses the point of what I am hoping to make. My gut reaction with most medical specimens is to call for them to be reinterred, mostly because the materials which I study have a dubious provenance---the bodies were stolen, like the myriad Indigenous remains at the Smithsonian’s Military Museum. Aligned with the death studies tradition, I forward an ideal of posthumous bodily autonomy, where individuals or communities have agency over how their remains are treated. There is a history of returning stolen remains in the United States with 1992’s Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act; although the successes of the law have been mixed in the thirty years since it was signed into law. My hand wringing about the treatment of remains in medical contexts is built on an assumption that, for the most part, most Americans around the turn of the twentieth century expected their bodies to be buried, and their resting place not to be disturbed.

Returning to the Henry Phipps Institute, and their brains, I want to stress that autopsy appears to contrast with American death rituals and stigmas. It is disrespectful for the dead to be treated in such a way, and it violates an assumed autonomy over a subject’s remains. Much of the death studies canon argues against the modernization of death because of its enclosure within medical institutions, because this separated community death rituals from the bodies of their loved ones. This also shifted the death rituals for many, perhaps without their knowing, because of the ways bodies were treated when institutionalized within hospitals like the Henry Phipps Institute. In the first two years, the institute conducted just under two hundred autopsies, and in the times it would benefit the institute, the scientists working there, or the promise of medicine, the patients’ bodies were made incomplete, all within the bailiwick of normal science. This dissertation contends that this extraction is a common practice upon which Modern medicine operated. Modern medicine requires some disregard for the postmortem autonomy of the subjects within its care to make its claims, because it depends on the very material which is extracted from the bodies of the dead.
